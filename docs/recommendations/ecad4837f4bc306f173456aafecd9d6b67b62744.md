Although the concept of an integrated signaling network replete with interpathway cross-talk and feedback regulation is broadly appreciated, kinetic data of the type needed to characterize such interactions in conjunction with mathematical models are lacking. In mammalian cells, the Ras/ERK pathway controls cell proliferation and other responses stimulated by growth factors, and several cross-talk and feedback mechanisms affecting its activation have been identified. In this work, we take a systematic approach to parse the magnitudes of multiple regulatory mechanisms that attenuate ERK activation through canonical (Ras-dependent) and non-canonical (PI3K-dependent) pathways. In addition to regulation of receptor and ligand levels, we consider three layers of ERK-dependent feedback: desensitization of Ras activation, negative regulation of MEK kinase (e.g. Raf) activities, and up-regulation of dual-specificity ERK phosphatases. Our results establish the second of these as the dominant mode of ERK self-regulation in mouse fibroblasts. We further demonstrate that kinetic models of signaling networks, trained on a sufficient diversity of quantitative data, can be reasonably comprehensive, accurate, and predictive in the dynamical sense.">

        <tr id="The Ras/ERK pathway drives cell proliferation and other oncogenic behaviors, and quantifying its activity in situ is of high interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Pathway activation is often assayed by measuring phosphorylated ERK. However, this form of measurement overlooks dynamic aspects of signaling that can only be observed over time. In this study, we combine a live, single-cell ERK biosensor approach with multiplexed immunofluorescence staining of downstream target proteins to ask how well immunostaining captures the dynamic history of ERK activity. Combining linear regression, machine learning, and differential equation models, we develop an interpretive framework for immunostains, in which Fra-1 and pRb levels imply long term activation of ERK signaling, while Egr-1 and c-Myc indicate recent activation. We show that this framework can distinguish different classes of ERK dynamics within a heterogeneous population, providing a tool for annotating ERK dynamics within fixed tissues.">

This raises the question how these diverse functions are specified and coordinated. In this work, we present an integrated computational model of ERK signal transduction pathway, investigating the regulatory mechanism of ERK signal pathway by variation of the concentration of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as the binding affinity of adaptor proteins. The results show that EGFR and distinct adaptor proteins engender different activation patterns of ERK, which will bring different cellular responses.

        <tr id="Building mechanistic models of kinase-driven signaling pathways requires quantitative measurements of protein phosphorylation across physiologically relevant conditions, but this is rarely done because of the insensitivity of traditional technologies. By using a multiplexed deep phosphoproteome profiling workflow, we were able to generate a deep phosphoproteomics dataset of the EGFR-MAPK pathway in non-transformed MCF10A cells across physiological ligand concentrations with a time resolution of <12 min and in the presence and absence of multiple kinase inhibitors. An improved phosphosite mapping technique allowed us to reliably identify >46,000 phosphorylation sites on >6600 proteins, of which >4500 sites from 2110 proteins displayed a >2-fold increase in phosphorylation in response to EGF. This data was then placed into a cellular context by linking it to 15 previously published protein databases. We found that our results were consistent with much, but not all previously reported data regarding the activation and negative feedback phosphorylation of core EGFR-ERK pathway proteins. We also found that EGFR signaling is biphasic with substrates downstream of RAS/MAPK activation showing a maximum response at <3ng/ml EGF while direct substrates, such as HGS and STAT5B, showing no saturation. We found that RAS activation is mediated by at least 3 parallel pathways, two of which depend on PTPN11. There appears to be an approximately 4-minute delay in pathway activation at the step between RAS and RAF, but subsequent pathway phosphorylation was extremely rapid. Approximately 80 proteins showed a >2-fold increase in phosphorylation across all experiments and these proteins had a significantly higher median number of phosphorylation sites (~18) relative to total cellular phosphoproteins (~4). Over 60% of EGF-stimulated phosphoproteins were downstream of MAPK and included mediators of cellular processes such as gene transcription, transport, signal transduction and cytoskeletal arrangement. Their phosphorylation was either linear with respect to MAPK activation or biphasic, corresponding to the biphasic signaling seen at the level of the EGFR. This deep, integrated phosphoproteomics data resource should be useful in building mechanistic models of EGFR and MAPK signaling and for understanding how downstream responses are regulated.">

Systems biology is currently focused on integrating intracellular networks, although clinically, diseases are largely defined by their histological features. For example, no computational model can simulate today the formation of a horizontally layered epidermis. Since the epidermis is the most complex structured epithelial tissue, systems biology models could yield important insights in epithelial tissue, in which most of all human cancers arise.


RESULTS
We describe the algorithms of a system, capable of simulating the tissue homeostasis in human epidermis leading to a horizontally layered tissue with cells of different differentiation stages. The system predicts epidermal morphology, tissue kinetics and 2D flow of Ca2+ ions. Predicted properties of an epidermis with a healthy and a disturbed barrier are compared with the literature. The system closely mimics the respecting physiological situations.

For systems biology of complex stratified epithelia like human epidermis, it will be of particular importance to reconstruct the spatiotemporal gene and protein networks regulating keratinocyte differentiation and homeostasis.


RESULTS
Inside the epidermis, the differentiation state of individual keratinocytes is correlated with their respective distance from the connective tissue. We here present a novel method to profile this correlation for multiple epithelial protein biomarkers in the form of quantitative spatial profiles. Profiles were computed by applying image processing algorithms to histological sections stained with tri-color indirect immunofluorescence. From the quantitative spatial profiles, reflecting the spatiotemporal changes of protein expression during cellular differentiation, graphs of protein networks were reconstructed.


CONCLUSION
Spatiotemporal networks can be used as a means for comparing and interpreting quantitative spatial protein expression profiles obtained from different tissue samples. In combination with automated microscopes, our new method supports the large-scale systems biological analysis of stratified epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="Psoriasis is an incurable chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by immune cytokine-stimulated epidermal hyperproliferation. This results in the skin becoming red with scaly plaques that can appear anywhere on the body, decreasing the quality of life for patients. Previous modelling studies of psoriasis have been limited to 2D models and lacked cell-cell interactions. We have developed a 3D agent-based model of epidermal cell dynamics to gain insights into how immune cytokine stimuli induces hyperproliferation in psoriasis to better understand disease formation and structural changes. Three main keratinocytes, stem, transit-amplifying (TA), differentiated and T cells, are modelled with proliferation and division governed by various nutrients and immune cytokines. Each cell has a set of attributes (growth rate, division probability, position, etc) whose values are governed by processes such as monod-based cellular growth model, probability-based division based on calcium and cytokine concentration and various forces to form the epidermal layers. The model has 2 steady states, healthy (non-lesional) and psoriatic (lesional) skin. Transition from healthy to psoriatic state is triggered by a temporary cytokine stimulus which causes hyperproliferation to occur, a hallmark of psoriasis. This results in the deepening of rete ridges and thickening of the epidermal structure. Model outputs has been validated against population ratios of stem, TA, differentiated, and T cells, cell cycle and turnover times in vivo. The model simulates the structural properties of epidermis, including layer stratification, formation of wave-like rete ridges, change in epidermal height and length of rete ridges from healthy to psoriasis. This has provided some insights on the complex spatio-temporal changes when transitioning between the 2 steady states and how a shot of temporary cytokine stimulus can induce different severity of psoriasis and alters proliferation between healthy and psoriatic skin in line with known literature. This provides the basis to study different cytokine simulation variations of psoriasis development and tracking of cell proliferation in the lab. It also provides a baseline to model the effects of psoriasis treatments such as narrowband-ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or biologics and predict potential treatment outcomes for patients.">

        <tr id="To understand how integration of multiple data types can help decipher cellular responses at the systems level, we analyzed the mitogenic response of human mammary epithelial cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) using whole genome microarrays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics and large-scale western blots with over 1000 antibodies. A time course analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of 3172 genes and 596 proteins, including protein phosphorylation changes measured by western blot. Integration of these disparate data types showed that each contributed qualitatively different components to the observed cell response to EGF and that varying degrees of concordance in gene expression and protein abundance measurements could be linked to specific biological processes. Networks inferred from individual data types were relatively limited, whereas networks derived from the integrated data recapitulated the known major cellular responses to EGF and exhibited more highly connected signaling nodes than networks derived from any individual dataset. While cell cycle regulatory pathways were altered as anticipated, we found the most robust response to mitogenic concentrations of EGF was induction of matrix metalloprotease cascades, highlighting the importance of the EGFR system as a regulator of the extracellular environment. These results demonstrate the value of integrating multiple levels of biological information to more accurately reconstruct networks of cellular response.">

        <tr id="The phosphorylation of cellular proteins plays a crucial role in the transduction of various signals from outside the cell into the nucleus. The signals are transduced by phosphorylation chain reactions within multiple pathways; however, determining which pathways are responsible for each defined signal has proven challenging. To estimate the activity of each pathway, we developed a phosphorylation array platform comprising a protein array with 1200 proteins belonging to 376 signalling pathways and an analytical method to estimate pathway activity based on the phosphorylation levels of proteins. The performance of our system was assessed by reconstructing kinase–substrate relationships, as well as by estimating pathway activity upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation and the pharmacological inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a result, kinase–substrate relationships were reliably reconstructed based on the precise measurement of phosphorylation levels of constituent proteins on the array. Furthermore, the pathway activities associated with EGF stimulation and EGFR inhibition were successfully traced through the related pathways from the outer membrane to the nucleus along a time course. Thus, our phosphorylation array system can effectively assess the activity of specific signalling pathways that are perturbed by extracellular stimuli, such as various drugs.">

Development and analysis of mathematical model can help us acquire a deep understanding of the complex behavior of ERK signal transduction network. This paper presents a computational model that offers an integrated quantitative and dynamic simulation of ERK signal transduction network, activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). The mathematic model contains the activation kinetics of the pathway, a multitude of feedback loops and connection of scaffold proteins. The model provides insight into signal-response relationships between the binding of EGF to its receptor at the cell surface and activation of downstream proteins in the signaling cascade. The different influence of positive and negative feedback loops of the ERK signal transduction pathway were mainly analyzed, indicating that feedback loops were the main impacting factor to the oscillation of ERK signal transduction pathway. The predictions of this oscillation of ERK activation agree well with the literature. It can lead to signal waves of the downstream substrates and induce corresponding biological behaviors.">

Graphical Abstract Highlights Signaling networks can be highly heterogeneous across cells in a tissue. Various technologies allow analyzing signaling networks at single-cell resolution. The advantages and limitations of each single-cell approach are summarized. Confounding factors in single-cell signaling network analysis are discussed. Signaling networks process intra- and extracellular information to modulate the functions of a cell. Deregulation of signaling networks results in abnormal cellular physiological states and often drives diseases. Network responses to a stimulus or a drug treatment can be highly heterogeneous across cells in a tissue because of many sources of cellular genetic and non-genetic variance. Signaling network heterogeneity is the key to many biological processes, such as cell differentiation and drug resistance. Only recently, the emergence of multiplexed single-cell measurement technologies has made it possible to evaluate this heterogeneity. In this review, we categorize currently established single-cell signaling network profiling approaches by their methodology, coverage, and application, and we discuss the advantages and limitations of each type of technology. We also describe the available computational tools for network characterization using single-cell data and discuss potential confounding factors that need to be considered in single-cell signaling network analyses.">

        <tr id="Psoriasis is the most common and chronic skin disease that affects individuals from every age group. The rate of psoriasis is increasing over the time in both developed and developing countries. Studies have revealed the possibility of association of psoriasis with skin cancers, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), which, include basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). There is a need to analyze the disease at molecular level to propose potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in comparison to cSCC. Therefore, the second analyzed disease of this study is cSCC. It is the second most common prevalent skin cancer all over the world with the potential to metastasize and recur. There is an urge to validate the proposed biomarkers and discover new potential biomarkers as well. In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the study, microarray and RNA-sequencing data analyses were performed followed by network analysis. Afterwards, quantitative systems biology was implemented to analyze the results at a holistic level. The aim was to predict the molecular patterns that can lead psoriasis to cancer. The current study proposed potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for psoriasis and cSCC. IL-17 signaling pathway is also identified as significant pathway in both diseases. Moreover, the current study proposed that autoimmune pathology, neutrophil recruitment, and immunity to extracellular pathogens are sensitive towards MAPKs (MAPK13 and MAPK14) and genes for AP-1 (FOSL1 and FOS). Therefore, these genes should be further studied in gene knock down based studies as they may play significant role in leading psoriasis towards cancer.">

Technical differences during the preparation and capture of stained images may influence the outcome of computational methods. Due to the specific nature of the analyzed material, no annotated datasets or dedicated methods are publicly available. Using a dataset with 598 unannotated images showing cross-sections of in vitro reconstructed human epidermis stained with DAB-based immunohistochemistry reaction to visualize four different keratinocyte differentiation marker proteins (filaggrin, keratin 10, Ki67, HSPA2) and counterstained with hematoxylin, we developed an unsupervised method for the detection and quantification of immunohistochemical staining.

The most effective combination of methods includes (i) Reinhard’s normalization; (ii) Ruifrok and Johnston color-deconvolution method; (iii) proposed image-rotation method based on boundary distribution of image intensity; and (iv) k-means clustering.

The MAPK cascade relays the presence of extracellular stimuli such as growth hormones to the nucleus and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. MAPKs control major cell fate decisions such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, mainly by inducing alterations in gene expression. In this chapter, we discuss how systems biology analysis provides insights into the functioning of this cascade. We show how this pathway assists the cell in responding properly to extracellular cues by filtering out sub-threshold stimuli, while efficiently transmitting physiologically relevant inputs. Several different receptors signal through the MAPK pathway even though they elicit opposite biological responses, thus raising the question of how specificity is achieved in MAPK signalling. Experimental studies revealed that specific biological responses are encoded by quantitative aspects of the MAPK signal such as amplitude or duration. We discuss mechanisms that enable the pathway to generate quantitatively different signals, and also explain how different signals are interpreted by the downstream gene expression machinery.">

For the efficient application of multi-agent systems to spatial and functional modeling of tissues flexible and intuitive modeling tools are needed, which allow the graphical specification of cellular behavior in a tissue context without presuming specialized programming skills.


RESULTS
We developed a graphical modeling system for multi-agent based simulation of tissue homeostasis. An editor allows the intuitive and hierarchically structured specification of cellular behavior. The models are then automatically compiled into highly efficient source code and dynamically linked to an interactive graphical simulation environment. The system allows the quantitative analysis of the morphological and functional tissue properties emerging from the cell behavioral model. We demonstrate the relevance of the approach using a recently published model of epidermal homeostasis as well as a series of cell-cycle models.

        <tr id="Motivation Signal transduction networks regulate a multitude of essential biological processes and are frequently aberrated in diseases such as cancer. Developing a mechanistic understanding of such networks is essential to understand disease or cell population specific signaling and to design effective treatment strategies. Typically, such networks are computationally reconstructed based on systematic perturbation experiments, followed by quantification of signaling protein activity. Recent technological advances now allow for the quantification of the activity of many (signaling) proteins simultaneously in single cells. This makes it feasible to reconstruct signaling networks from single cell data. Results Here we introduce single cell Comparative Network Reconstruction (scCNR) to derive signal transduction networks by exploiting the heterogeneity of single cell (phospho)protein measurements. scCNR treats stochastic variation in total protein abundances as natural perturbation experiments, whose effects propagate through the network. scCNR reconstructs cell population specific networks of the same underlying topology for cells from diverse populations. We extensively validated scCNR on simulated single cell data, and we applied it to a dataset of EGFR-inhibitor treated keratinocytes to recover signaling differences downstream of EGFR and in protein interactions associated with proliferation. scCNR will help to unravel the mechanistic signaling differences between cell populations by making use of single-cell data, and will subsequently guide the development of well-informed treatment strategies. Availability and implementation scCNR is available as a python module at https://github.com/ibivu/scmra. Additionally, code to reproduce all figures is available at https://github.com/tstohn/scmra_analysis.

Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways regulate diverse cellular processes ranging from proliferation and differentiation to apoptosis. In mammals, out of five, there are three well characterized subfamilies of MAPKs ‐ ERKs (Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases), JNKs (c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases), and P38 kinases, and their activators, are implicated in human diseases and are targets for drug development. Kinase cascades in MAPK pathways mediate the sensing and processing of stimuli. To understand how cells makes decisions, the dynamic interactions of components of signaling cascades are important rather than just creating static maps. Based on enzyme kinetic reactions, we have developed a mathematical model to analyze the impact of the cross‐talks between JNK and P38 kinase cascades. Cross‐talks between JNK and P38 kinase cascades influence the activities of P38 kinases. Responses of the signals should be studied for network of kinase cascades by considering cross‐talks.">

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been studied extensively because of its critical role in cellular signaling and association with disease. Previous models have elucidated interactions between EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins or showed phenotypes affected by EGFR. However, the link between specific EGFR phosphorylation sites and phenotypic outcomes is still poorly understood. Here, we employed a suite of isogenic cell lines expressing site-specific mutations at each of the EGFR C-terminal phosphorylation sites to interrogate their role in the signaling network and cell biological response to stimulation. Our results demonstrate the resilience of the EGFR network, which was largely similar even in the context of multiple Y-to-F mutations in the EGFR C-terminal tail, while also revealing nodes in the network that have not previously been linked to EGFR signaling. Our data-driven model highlights the signaling network nodes associated with distinct EGF-driven cell responses, including migration, proliferation, and receptor trafficking. Application of this same approach to less-studied RTKs should provide a plethora of novel associations that should lead to an improved understanding of these signaling networks.">

        <tr id="The biophysical properties of ligand binding heavily influence the ability of receptors to specify cell fates. Understanding the rules by which ligand binding kinetics impact cell phenotype is challenging, however, because of the coupled information transfers that occur from receptors to downstream signaling effectors and from effectors to phenotypes. Here, we address that issue by developing an integrated mechanistic and data-driven computational modeling platform to predict cell responses to different ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Experimental data for model training and validation were generated using MCF7 human breast cancer cells treated with the high- and low-affinity ligands epidermal growth factor (EGF) and epiregulin (EREG), respectively. The integrated model captures the unintuitive, concentration-dependent abilities of EGF and EREG to drive signals and phenotypes differently, even at similar levels of receptor occupancy. For example, the model correctly predicts the dominance of EREG over EGF in driving a cell differentiation phenotype through AKT signaling at intermediate and saturating ligand concentrations and the ability of EGF and EREG to drive a broadly concentration-sensitive migration phenotype through cooperative ERK and AKT signaling. Parameter sensitivity analysis identifies EGFR endocytosis, which is differentially regulated by EGF and EREG, as one of the most important determinants of the alternative phenotypes driven by different ligands. The integrated model provides a new platform to predict how phenotypes are controlled by the earliest biophysical rate processes in signal transduction and may eventually be leveraged to understand receptor signaling system performance depends on cell context.

        <tr id="Abstract. Significance: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive, in vivo technology that offers near histopathological resolution at the cellular level. It is useful in the study of phenomena for which obtaining a biopsy is impractical or would cause unnecessary tissue damage and trauma to the patient. Aim: This review covers the use of RCM in the study of skin and the use of machine learning to automate information extraction. It has two goals: (1) an overview of information provided by RCM on skin structure and how it changes over time in response to stimuli and in disease and (2) an overview of machine learning approaches developed to automate the extraction of key morphological features from RCM images. Approach: A PubMed search was conducted with additional literature obtained from references lists. Results: The application of RCM as an in vivo tool in dermatological research and the biologically relevant information derived from it are presented. Algorithms for image classification to epidermal layers, delineation of the dermal–epidermal junction, classification of skin lesions, and demarcation of individual cells within an image, all important factors in the makeup of the skin barrier, were reviewed. Application of image analysis methods in RCM is hindered by low image quality due to noise and/or poor contrast. Use of supervised machine learning is limited by time-consuming manual labeling of RCM images. Conclusions: RCM has great potential in the study of skin structures. The use of artificial intelligence could enable an easier, more reproducible, precise, and rigorous study of RCM images for the understanding of skin structures, skin barrier, and skin inflammation and lesions. Although several attempts have been made, further work is still needed to provide a definite gold standard and overcome issues related to image quality, limited labeled datasets, and lack of phenotype variability in available databases.">

Here, we develop a detailed computational model for TGF-β signalling that incorporates elements of previous models together with crosstalking between Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3 channels through a negative feedback loop dependent on Smad7. The resulting model accurately reproduces the diverse behaviour of experimental datasets for human keratinocytes, bovine aortic endothelial cells and mouse mesenchymal cells, capturing the dynamics of activation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of both R-Smad channels. The analysis of the model dynamics and its system properties revealed Smad7-mediated crosstalking between Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3 channels as a major determinant in shaping the distinct responses to single and multiple ligand stimulation for different cell types.">

        <tr id="Abstract Computer simulations and mathematical modeling of biological processes are becoming increasingly popular, and yet the complexity of the biochemical systems or the differences between experimental setups make it very difficult to establish a standard formula for these modeling projects. Before we can start using computer‐based models for predictions or targeted experiment designs, it is very important to establish a reliable model on which those predictions can be based and experimentally tested. Here we attempt to present a computer model for the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade which is consistent with previously published experimental results. In this study we have focused our attention to a generic MAPK ERK (extracellular signal‐regulated kinase) pathway activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in an attempt to understand how receptors may achieve different activation kinetics of the MAPK signaling. We successfully show that the level of receptor expression is one key determinant in this regulation, and that the binding affinity of the active receptor to adaptor proteins can have a small but albeit direct effect on the downstream activation.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway is a complex signalling process with a wide network of interactions. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) cascade by this activated EGFR has been well studied. MAPKs form a highly integrated network, which is essential for certain specialised cell functions. This paper presents a kinetic model for the MAPK pathway downstream of the EGFR using a biochemical simulator. The model includes 30 signalling events and 29 signalling molecules. The time course data were examined for the activation of each signalling component. The simulation provides a large volume of data, by monitoring the kinetics of the signalling components, which were compared experimentally using the PC12 cell line. The kinetic model corresponded well with the experimental results observed in the EGFR induced activation of proteins. An examination of the kinetic analysis of the multiple signalling events provides a quantitative framework for representing the EGFR signalling network.">

        <tr id="Cellular information processing in signaling networks forms the basis of responses to environmental stimuli. At any given time, cells receive multiple simultaneous input cues, which are processed and integrated to determine cellular responses such as migration, proliferation, apoptosis, or differentiation. Protein phosphorylation events play a major role in this process and are often involved in fundamental biological and cellular processes such as protein‐protein interactions, enzyme activity, and immune responses. Determining which kinases phosphorylate specific phospho sites poses a challenge; this information is critical when trying to elucidate key proteins involved in specific cellular responses. Here, methods to generate high‐quality quantitative phosphorylation data from cell lysates originating from primary cells, and how to analyze the generated data to construct quantitative signaling network models, are presented. These models can subsequently be used to guide follow‐up in vitro/in vivo validation studies. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 104:11.11.1‐11.11.23. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.">

        <tr id="In this study, we aimed to develop a novel method for non-invasively determining intracellular protein levels, which is essential for understanding cellular phenomena. This understanding hinges on insights into gene expression, cell morphology, dynamics, and intercellular interactions. Traditional cell analysis techniques, such as immunostaining, live imaging, next-generation sequencing, and single-cell analysis, despite rapid advancements, face challenges in comprehensively integrating gene and protein expression data with spatiotemporal information. Leveraging advances in machine learning for image analysis, we designed a new model to estimate cellular biomarker protein levels using a blend of phase-contrast and fluorescent immunostaining images of epidermal keratinocytes. By iterating this process across various proteins, our model can estimate multiple protein levels from a single phase-contrast image. Additionally, we developed a system for analyzing multiple protein expression levels alongside spatiotemporal data through live imaging and phase-contrast methods. Our study offers valuable tools for cell-based research and presents a new avenue for addressing molecular biological challenges.">

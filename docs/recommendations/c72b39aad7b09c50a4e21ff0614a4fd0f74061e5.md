        <tr id="Recent advancements in machine learning-based data processing techniques have facilitated the inference of gene regulatory interactions and the identification of key genes from multidimensional gene expression data. In this study, we applied a stepwise Bayesian framework to uncover a novel regulatory component involved in differentiation of specific neural and neuronal cells. We treated naive neural precursor cells with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) at various concentrations and time points, generating comprehensive whole-genome sequencing data that captured dynamic gene expression profiles during differentiation. The genes were categorized into 224 subsets based on their expression profiles, and the relationships between these subsets were extrapolated. To accurately predict gene regulation among subsets, known networks were used as a core model and subsets to be added were tested stepwise. This approach led to the identification of a novel component involved in neural tube patterning within gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which was experimentally validated. Our study highlights the effectiveness of in silico modeling for extrapolating GRNs during neural development.">

        <tr id="Elucidation of the mechanisms of stem cell differentiation is of great scientific interest. Increasing evidence suggests that stem cell differentiation involves changes at multiple levels of biological regulation, which together orchestrate the complex differentiation process; many related studies have been performed to investigate the various levels of regulation. The resulting valuable data, however, remain scattered. Most of the current stem cell-relevant databases focus on a single level of regulation (mRNA expression) from limited stem cell types; thus, a unifying resource would be of great value to compile the multiple levels of research data available. Here we present a database for this purpose, SyStemCell, deposited with multi-level experimental data from stem cell research. The database currently covers seven levels of stem cell differentiation-associated regulatory mechanisms, including DNA CpG 5-hydroxymethylcytosine/methylation, histone modification, transcript products, microRNA-based regulation, protein products, phosphorylation proteins and transcription factor regulation, all of which have been curated from 285 peer-reviewed publications selected from PubMed. The database contains 43,434 genes, recorded as 942,221 gene entries, for four organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Macaca mulatta) and various stem cell sources (e.g., embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells). Data in SyStemCell can be queried by Entrez gene ID, symbol, alias, or browsed by specific stem cell type at each level of genetic regulation. An online analysis tool is integrated to assist researchers to mine potential relationships among different regulations, and the potential usage of the database is demonstrated by three case studies. SyStemCell is the first database to bridge multi-level experimental information of stem cell studies, which can become an important reference resource for stem cell researchers. The database is available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SyStemCell/.">

        <tr id="Experimental data from biological pathways come in many forms: qualitative or quantitative, static or dynamic. By combining a variety of these heterogeneous sources of data, we construct a mathematical model of a critical regulatory network in vertebrate development, the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. The structure of our model is first constrained by several well-established pathway interactions. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical genetic algorithm that is capable of integrating different types of experimental data collected on the pathway's function, including qualitative as well as static and dynamic quantitative data, in order to estimate model parameters. The result is a dynamical model that fits the observed data and is robust to perturbations in its parameters. Since it is based on a canonical power-law representation of biochemical pathways whose parameters can be directly translated into physical interactions between network components, our model provides insight into the nature and strength of pathway interactions and suggests directions for future research.">

        <tr id="The segmentation of the vertebrate body is laid down during early embryogenesis. The formation of signaling gradients, the periodic expression of genes of the Notch-, Fgf- and Wnt-pathways and their interplay in the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm (PSM) precedes the rhythmic budding of nascent somites at its anterior end, which later develops into epithelialized structures, the somites. Although many in silico models describing partial aspects of somitogenesis already exist, simulations of a complete causal chain from gene expression in the growth zone via the interaction of multiple cells to segmentation are rare. Here, we present an enhanced gene regulatory network (GRN) for mice in a simulation program that models the growing PSM by many virtual cells and integrates WNT3A and FGF8 gradient formation, periodic gene expression and Delta/Notch signaling. Assuming Hes7 as core of the somitogenesis clock and LFNG as modulator, we postulate a negative feedback of HES7 on Dll1 leading to an oscillating Dll1 expression as seen in vivo. Furthermore, we are able to simulate the experimentally observed wave of activated NOTCH (NICD) as a result of the interactions in the GRN. We esteem our model as robust for a wide range of parameter values with the Hes7 mRNA and protein decays exerting a strong influence on the core oscillator. Moreover, our model predicts interference between Hes1 and HES7 oscillators when their intrinsic frequencies differ. In conclusion, we have built a comprehensive model of somitogenesis with HES7 as core oscillator that is able to reproduce many experimentally observed data in mice.">

The US and UK are most active in SCs publications related to AI/ML and AI/DL. The prominent use of SysBio in ESC research was recently overtaken by prominent use of AI in iPSC and MSC research.

        <tr id="SUMMARY
The characterization of the complex phenomenon of cell differentiation is a key goal of both systems and computational biology. GeStoDifferent is a Cytoscape plugin aimed at the generation and the identification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describing an arbitrary stochastic cell differentiation process. The (dynamical) model adopted to describe general GRNs is that of noisy random Boolean networks (NRBNs), with a specific focus on their emergent dynamical behavior. GeStoDifferent explores the space of GRNs by filtering the NRBN instances inconsistent with a stochastic lineage differentiation tree representing the cell lineages that can be obtained by following the fate of a stem cell descendant. Matched networks can then be analyzed by Cytoscape network analysis algorithms or, for instance, used to define (multiscale) models of cellular dynamics.

Individual overexpression of eleven TFs and several combinations in hESCs found novel neural induction regulators.

        <tr id="Proper tissue development requires that stem/progenitor cells precisely coordinate cell division and differentiation in space and time. Notch-Hes1 intercellular signaling, which affects both differentiation and cell cycle progression and directs cell fate decisions at various developmental stages in many cell types, is central to this process. This study explored whether the pattern of connections among the cell cycle regulatory module, the Notch effector Hes1 and the proneural factor Ngn2 could explain salient aspects of cell fate determination in neural progenitors. A mathematical model that includes mutual interactions between Hes1, Ngn2 and G1-phase regulators was constructed and simulated at the single- and two-cell levels. By differentially regulating G1-phase progression, Hes1 and Ngn2 are shown to induce two contrasting cell cycle arrest states in early and late G1, respectively. Indeed, steady Hes1 overexpression promotes reversible quiescence by downregulating activators of G0/G1 exit and Ngn2. Ngn2 also downregulates activators of G0/G1 exit, but cooperates with Cip/Kip proteins to prevent G1/S transit, whereby it promotes G1-phase lengthening and, ultimately, contributes to reinforcing an irreversible late G1 arrest coincident with terminal differentiation. In this scheme, Hes1 oscillation in single cells is able to maintain a labile proliferation state in dynamic balance with two competing cell fate outputs associated with Hes1-mediated and Ngn2-mediated cell cycle arrest states. In Delta/Notch-connected cells, Hes1 oscillations and a lateral inhibition mechanism combine to establish heterogeneous Hes1, Ngn2 and cell cycle dynamics between proliferating neural progenitors, thereby increasing the chances of asymmetric cell fate decisions and improving the reliability of commitment to differentiation. Summary: Computational modelling deciphers the connections between the cell-cycle machinery and Notch signalling which govern whether neural stem cells proliferate, differentiate or enter quiescence.">

        <tr id="The Notch signaling pathway controls numerous cell fate decisions during development and adulthood through diverse mechanisms. Thus, whereas it functions as an oscillator during somitogenesis, it can mediate an all-or-none cell fate switch to influence pattern formation in various tissues during development. Furthermore, while in some contexts continuous Notch signaling is required, in others a transient Notch signal is sufficient to influence cell fate decisions. However, the signaling mechanisms that underlie these diverse behaviors in different cellular contexts have not been understood. Notch1 along with two downstream transcription factors hes1 and RBP-Jk forms an intricate network of positive and negative feedback loops, and we have implemented a systems biology approach to computationally study this gene regulation network. Our results indicate that the system exhibits bistability and is capable of switching states at a critical level of Notch signaling initiated by its ligand Delta in a particular range of parameter values. In this mode, transient activation of Delta is also capable of inducing prolonged high expression of Hes1, mimicking the âONâ state depending on the intensity and duration of the signal. Furthermore, this system is highly sensitive to certain model parameters and can transition from functioning as a bistable switch to an oscillator by tuning a single parameter value. This parameter, the transcriptional repression constant of hes1, can thus qualitatively govern the behavior of the signaling network. In addition, we find that the system is able to dampen and reduce the effects of biological noise that arise from stochastic effects in gene expression for systems that respond quickly to Notch signaling. This work thus helps our understanding of an important cell fate control system and begins to elucidate how this context dependent signaling system can be modulated in different cellular settings to exhibit entirely different behaviors.">

        <tr id="Background Recent studies have associated the transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as parts of a self-regulating network which is responsible for maintaining embryonic stem cell properties: self renewal and pluripotency. In addition, mutual antagonism between two of these and other master regulators have been shown to regulate lineage determination. In particular, an excess of Cdx2 over Oct4 determines the trophectoderm lineage whereas an excess of Gata-6 over Nanog determines differentiation into the endoderm lineage. Also, under/over-expression studies of the master regulator Oct4 have revealed that some self-renewal/pluripotency as well as differentiation genes are expressed in a biphasic manner with respect to the concentration of Oct4. Methodology/Principal Findings We construct a dynamical model of a minimalistic network, extracted from ChIP-on-chip and microarray data as well as literature studies. The model is based upon differential equations and makes two plausible assumptions; activation of Gata-6 by Oct4 and repression of Nanog by an Oct4âGata-6 heterodimer. With these assumptions, the results of simulations successfully describe the biphasic behavior as well as lineage commitment. The model also predicts that reprogramming the network from a differentiated state, in particular the endoderm state, into a stem cell state, is best achieved by over-expressing Nanog, rather than by suppression of differentiation genes such as Gata-6. Conclusions The computational model provides a mechanistic understanding of how different lineages arise from the dynamics of the underlying regulatory network. It provides a framework to explore strategies of reprogramming a cell from a differentiated state to a stem cell state through directed perturbations. Such an approach is highly relevant to regenerative medicine since it allows for a rapid search over the host of possibilities for reprogramming to a stem cell state.">

To elucidate how different responses can arise from conserved signaling networks, we have developed a mathematical model of the well-characterized Caenorhabditis vulval development network involving EGF, Wnt and Notch signaling that recapitulates biologically observed behaviors. We experimentally block a specific element of the EGF pathway (MEK), and find different behaviors in vulval development in two Caenorhabditis species, C. elegans and C. briggsae. When we separate our parameters into subsets that correspond to these two responses, they yield model behaviors that are consistent with observed experimental results, despite the initial parameter grouping based on perturbation in a single node of the EGF pathway. Finally, our analysis predicts specific parameters that may be critical for the theoretically and experimentally observed differences, suggesting modifications that might allow intentional switching between the two species' responses. Our results indicate that all manipulations within a signal transduction pathway do not yield the same outcome, and provide a framework to identify the specific genetic perturbations within a conserved network that will confer unique behaviors on the network.">

Simple 11 cell cycle mathematical model of NG within pseudostratified ventricular epithelia (PVE) has been proposed and magnitude of the programmed cell death in CP during early postnatal life has been estimated. We developed system dynamics model of the NG in mouse neocortex that integrates available experimental data. Simulation experiments were run in order to establish its stability, validity and dependence on initial parameters. Following experimental data were used for PVE and CP at future area 1 of the murine neocortex: 1) cell cycle duration ; 2) q factor (proportion of the ongoing mitosis giving birth to young postmitotic neurons (PN)) during neurogenetic interval (NI) ; 3) growth fraction ; 4) duration of migration ; 5) distribution of young postmitotic neurons within CP as function of their time of birth ; and 6) proportion of cells that undergoes programmed cell death within CP in early postnatal life. Model was developed and tested with system dynamics software Stella 8.0 for Windows XP operating system. Duration of the cell cycle, cortical distribution of young postmitotic neurons and proportion of dying cells were implemented as table-vice-linear function with linear interpolation. Growth fraction and duration of migration were constant. Q factor was estimated by polynomial fit that was obtained by Microsoft Excel 2003 software. Simulation experiments were conducted with starting population of 1*103 cells, equally distributed throughout cell cycle, for the time frame from 11th embryonal (E11) to 22nd postnatal (P22) day. Eulerâ s integration method was used ; with integration time (DT) equaled 1/10 hours. NI lasted for 150 hours (E11+4, 9h â E17+10, 9h). Each cell of the starting population of the PVE at the beginning of NI gave rise to ~145 postmitotic neurons. Population of the PVE was largest at E14+13, 5h. Distribution by layers (in %) was as follows: VI-23, 1 ; V-9, 0 ; IV-26, 4 ; III/II-41 ; I-0, 6. During NI, cells of the PVE executed 11 cell cycles if they just entered G1 phase at the onset of neurogenetic interval, but only 10 cycles if they were anywhere in the cell cycle at least 1.6 hours away from the start of G1 phase. Overall reduction PN number within CP in the early postnatal life (P0-P14) was 28, 0%. Reduction by layers (in %) was as follows: VI â 16, 6 ; V-11, 5 ; IV-24, 5 ; III/II-40, 3 ; I-20, 7. Final number of PN linearly depends on the size of the founder population within PVE, but polynomial (2nd order) on the length of the cell cycle. Alteration of q-factor considerably influenced final neuron number. Model was shown to be stable for given parameters providing repeatable results in each performed experiment. Results of simulation experiments were in accordance to experimentally observed facts for onset of NI, its duration, time of maximal size of PVE, and persistent migration of PN during early postnatal life. Cortical distribution of PN and postnatal cell death within CP showed differences when compared with previously published data that might be attributed to the numerical estimation methods used and populations of neurons that were not included in the model (SPP, GE, ML, SP). System dynamics was found suitable for simulation modeling of quantitative developmental cellular processes enabling integration of available experimental data into single model.">

        <tr id="Motivation: Animals from worms and insects to birds and mammals show distinct body plans; however, the embryonic development of diverse body plans with tissues and organs within is controlled by a surprisingly few signaling pathways. It is well recognized that combinatorial use of and dynamic interactions among signaling pathways follow specific logic to control complex and accurate developmental signaling and patterning, but it remains elusive what such logic is, or even, what it looks like. Results: We have developed a computational model for Drosophila eye development with innovated methods to reveal how interactions among multiple pathways control the dynamically generated hexagonal array of R8 cells. We obtained two novel findings. First, the coupling between the long-range inductive signals produced by the proneural Hh signaling and the short-range restrictive signals produced by the antineural Notch and EGFR signaling is essential for generating accurately spaced R8s. Second, the spatiotemporal orders of key signaling events reveal a robust pattern of lateral inhibition conducted by Ato-coordinated Notch and EGFR signaling to collectively determine R8 patterning. This pattern, stipulating the orders of signaling and comparable to the protocols of communication, may help decipher the well-appreciated but poorly defined logic of developmental signaling.

        <tr id="MOTIVATION
Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development is a paradigmatic example of animal organogenesis with extensive experimental data. During vulval induction, each of the six multipotent vulval precursor cells (VPCs) commits to one of three fates (primary, secondary, tertiary). The precise primary-secondary-tertiary formation of VPC fates is controlled by a network of intercellular signaling, intracellular signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. The construction of mathematical models for this network will enable hypothesis generation, biological mechanism discovery and system behavior analysis.


RESULTS
We have developed a mathematical model based on dynamic Bayesian networks to model the biological network that governs the VPC primary-secondary-tertiary pattern formation process. Our model has six interconnected subnetworks corresponding to six VPCs. Each VPC subnetwork contains 20 components. The causal relationships among network components are quantitatively encoded in the structure and parameters of the model. Statistical machine learning techniques were developed to automatically learn both the structure and parameters of the model from data collected from literatures. The learned model is capable of simulating vulval induction under 36 different genetic conditions. Our model also contains a few hypothetical causal relationships between network components, and hence can serve as guidance for designing future experiments. The statistical learning nature of our methodology makes it easy to not only handle noise in data but also automatically incorporate new experimental data to refine the model.

        <tr id="Abstract Glioblastomas and glioblastoma stem cells are heterogeneous with respect to mutations, gene expression, and response to drugs. To make predictive responses of individual GBM stem cell lines to drugs, we have constructed a causal model of glioblastoma stem cell signaling. The core model was built starting from pathways identified from TCGA mutation data with the addition of the Jak/STAT, Hedgehog, and Notch pathways. Elements and relations between them were validated and extended using the PCNet interaction database and the INDRA database which includes machine read extractions from the biomedical literature. The result is a high confidence executable model consisting of 209 element and 370 rules of interaction between the elements. Stochastic simulations of the model provide dynamic (quantile) changes in time and responses to perturbations. The output provides activity of individual nodes as well as a cellular output state of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or differentiation. To simulate the responses of individual cell lines to kinase inhibitors, the model was initialized using DNA sequencing data, RNA-seq, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from each cell line. Comparing the results of the simulations to the drug responses of 11 different kinase targets, the model was 88% accurate in predicting effects on growth and survival. The model was further tested by comparing the effects of Mek inhibition of each of the cell lines in model to the results observed in the RPPA data which overlap by 127 elements. In this case, there was 62% concordance between the model and data when binned into quintiles. Discrepancies between the model predictions and the data are being investigated to determine whether the model logic or extent needs to be revised to improve the model. This modeling approach is a step toward developing algorithms for personalized therapeutics for GBM based on multi-omics data.">

        <tr id="Hematopoiesis is a highly complex developmental process that produces various types of blood cells. This process is regulated by different genetic networks that control the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although substantial progress has been made for understanding hematopoiesis, the detailed regulatory mechanisms for the fate determination of HSCs are still unraveled. In this study, we propose a novel approach to infer the detailed regulatory mechanisms. This work is designed to develop a mathematical framework that is able to realize nonlinear gene expression dynamics accurately. In particular, we intended to investigate the effect of possible protein heterodimers and/or synergistic effect in genetic regulation. This approach includes the Extended Forward Search Algorithm to infer network structure (top-down approach) and a non-linear mathematical model to infer dynamical property (bottom-up approach). Based on the published experimental data, we study two regulatory networks of 11 genes for regulating the erythrocyte differentiation pathway and the neutrophil differentiation pathway. The proposed algorithm is first applied to predict the network topologies among 11 genes and 55 non-linear terms which may be for heterodimers and/or synergistic effect. Then, the unknown model parameters are estimated by fitting simulations to the expression data of two different differentiation pathways. In addition, the edge deletion test is conducted to remove possible insignificant regulations from the inferred networks. Furthermore, the robustness property of the mathematical model is employed as an additional criterion to choose better network reconstruction results. Our simulation results successfully realized experimental data for two different differentiation pathways, which suggests that the proposed approach is an effective method to infer the topological structure and dynamic property of genetic regulations.">

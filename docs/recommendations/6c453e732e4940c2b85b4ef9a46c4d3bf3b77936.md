Hereby to improve the ways of giving the intervention, we propose a computational agent based model called PROCANINT in our paper which can be used as a reference for successively carrying various clinical trials on prostate cancer patients to treat the cancer. Safety & efficacy of drug to be given to a patient for treating cancer can be analysed and modified accordingly.The model serves as platform to compare different drugs impact on prostate cancer and improvement of tumour reduction assessed by reduction of prostate specific antigen. Computer simulations enable one to perform several 'what-if ‘analyses cost effectively.">

In this paper, we develop a computational framework for identifying patient-specific androgen ablation therapy schedules for postponing the potential cancer relapse. We model the population dynamics of heterogeneous prostate cancer cells in response to androgen suppression as a nonlinear hybrid automaton. We estimate personalized kinetic parameters to characterize patients and employ δ-reachability analysis to predict patient-specific therapeutic strategies. The results show that our methods are promising and may lead to a prognostic tool for prostate cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Significance We perform a tissue-scale, personalized computer simulation of prostate cancer (PCa) growth in a patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from medical images. To do so, we propose a mathematical model for the growth of PCa. The model includes an equation for the reference biomarker of PCa: the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Hence, we can link the results of our model to data that urologists can easily interpret. Our model reproduces features of prostatic tumor growth observed in experiments and clinical practice. It also captures a known shift in the growth pattern of PCa, from spheroidal to fingered geometry. Our results indicate that this shape instability is a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific) basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed “predictive medicine.” Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem and an ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second, tumor growth can be estimated by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use diffusion−reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to fingered growth. Results of our computations indicate that such shift is a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival and further development. We have also used our model to perform tissue-scale, personalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is the second most occurring cancer in men worldwide. To better understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and possible treatment responses, we developed a mathematical model of prostate cancer which considers the major signalling pathways known to be deregulated. We personalised this Boolean model to molecular data to reflect the heterogeneity and specific response to perturbations of cancer patients. A total of 488 prostate samples were used to build patient-specific models and compared to available clinical data. Additionally, eight prostate cell line-specific models were built to validate our approach with dose-response data of several drugs. The effects of single and combined drugs were tested in these models under different growth conditions. We identified 15 actionable points of interventions in one cell line-specific model whose inactivation hinders tumorigenesis. To validate these results, we tested nine small molecule inhibitors of five of those putative targets and found a dose-dependent effect on four of them, notably those targeting HSP90 and PI3K. These results highlight the predictive power of our personalised Boolean models and illustrate how they can be used for precision oncology.">

        <tr id="e16528 Background: Prostate cancer is the most common solid malignancy in men and despite improving radical therapies a proportion of patients will develop castrate resistant metastatic disease (mCRPC). Therapeutic options in mCRPC include abiraterone acetate and prednisolone (AA+P), enzalutamide (E) and docetaxel (D) with limited evidence to guide clinical choice between agents. COMPACT aims to collate data from multiple data sets within one hospital to assess clinical or biochemical factors that may guide therapeutic strategy. Methods: Data was collated on all patients recorded as receiving therapy with AA+P, E or D in the metastatic castrate resistant setting from the chemotherapy prescribing and dispensing systems and the pathology system at University College Hospital, London. Individual clinical notes were reviewed to determine the reason for stopping therapies. Data was collated in one dataset and analysed to present baseline demographic data. The log-rank test was used to analyse differences in the retention rate among AA+P, E and D. Results: 598 individual treatments were identified in 441 patients. 172 patients received AA+P, 119 E and 307 D with a mean age at treatment initiation of 74.1, 76.8 and 69.5 years respectively. Of the 144 patients receiving two or more treatment lines, 62% (n = 89) received D prior to either AA+P or E. E was first line therapy in 18% (n = 26) and AA+P in 20% (n = 29). 5 (3.5%) patients transferred directly from AA+P to E and 12 (8%) from E to AA+P. Kaplan Meir estimates for time to retention show no statistically significant differences when directly comparing AA+P, E and D on univariate analysis with chi squared test (AA+P vs E = 0.3609, p = 0.558 D vs E = 0.365, p = 0.5457, D vs AA+P = 0.0136 p = 0.9072). Conclusions: The COMPACT study has confirmed that it is feasible for single institutions to retrospectively review real world data from different sources, combining it into a workable database. Patient numbers were sufficient to statistically analyse the data for specific clinical factors that may correlate to a prolonged biochemical response to AA+P, E or D therapy. The failure to detect a statistically significant difference between therapies on univariate analysis may confirm that all three are acceptable treatments in mCRPC.">

        <tr id="Purpose: This study introduces a pioneering hybrid model that combines genetic algorithms, neuro-fuzzy logic, and mobile agent technology to enhance predictive precision for early-stage prostate cancer diagnosis. 
Design/Methodology/Approach: One hundred and twenty records of prostate cancer patients were initially collected from the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara, Nigeria. Each patient’s record included relevant data on prostate disease, such as age, PSA levels, clinical history, symptom severity, biopsy results, and other demographic and clinical factors. This data was extracted and stored as rules in a MySQL database, with the MySQL Fuzzy Extension enabling fuzzy data storage and processing. 
Findings: Extensive simulations and clinical data analyses demonstrate the model’s superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting early-stage prostate cancer compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Medical expert evaluations validate the model’s effectiveness as a promising diagnostic alternative. 
Research Limitation: While results are promising, the study is limited to simulations and a controlled clinical dataset. 
Practical Implications: The system offers a practical, scalable early prostate cancer detection solution that could revolutionise current diagnostic practices. 
Social Implications: Potential social benefits include improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and better quality of life. 
Originality/Value: This study presents an innovative integration of genetic algorithms, neuro-fuzzy systems, and mobile agent technology. This novel approach paves the way for advanced cancer diagnostics and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major world-wide health concern. Current diagnostic methods involve Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood tests, biopsies, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess cancer aggressiveness and guide treatment decisions. MRI aligns with in silico medicine, as patient-specific image biomarkers can be obtained, contributing towards the development of digital twins for clinical practice. This work presents a novel framework to create a personalized PCa model by integrating clinical MRI data, such as the prostate and tumour geometry, the initial distribution of cells and the vasculature, so a full representation of the whole prostate is obtained. On top of the personalized model construction, our approach simulates and predicts temporal tumour growth in the prostate through the Finite Element Method, coupling the dynamics of tumour growth and the transport of oxygen, and incorporating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition, our approach includes the simulation of the PSA dynamics, which allows to evaluate tumour growth through the PSA patient’s levels. To obtain the model parameters, a multi-objective optimization process is performed to adjust the best parameters for two patients simultaneously. This framework is validated by means of data from four patients with several MRI follow-ups. The diagnosis MRI allows the model creation and initialization, while subsequent MRI-based data provide additional information to validate computational predictions. The model predicts prostate and tumour volumes growth, along with serum PSA levels. This work represents a preliminary step towards the creation of digital twins for PCa patients, providing personalized insights into tumour growth.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary We describe a risk profile reconstruction model for cancer-specific survival estimation for continuous time points after urologic cancer diagnosis. We used artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms, a national cancer registry data, and accessible clinical parameters for the risk-profile reconstruction. We derived a risk stratification model and estimated the minimum follow-up duration and the likelihood for risk stability in prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers. The estimated follow-up duration was in alignment with recognized clinical guidelines for these cancers. Moreover, the estimated follow-up duration was differed by the cancer origin and the disease dissemination status. Overall, the reconstruction of the population’s risk profile for the cancer-specific prognostic score estimation is feasible using AI and has potential application in clinical settings to improve risk stratification and surveillance management. Abstract Background: Prognostication is essential to determine the risk profile of patients with urologic cancers. Methods: We utilized the SEER national cancer registry database with approximately 2 million patients diagnosed with urologic cancers (penile, testicular, prostate, bladder, ureter, and kidney). The cohort was randomly divided into the development set (90%) and the out-held test set (10%). Modeling algorithms and clinically relevant parameters were utilized for cancer-specific mortality prognosis. The model fitness for the survival estimation was assessed using the differences between the predicted and observed Kaplan–Meier estimates on the out-held test set. The overall concordance index (c-index) score estimated the discriminative accuracy of the survival model on the test set. A simulation study assessed the estimated minimum follow-up duration and time points with the risk stability. Results: We achieved a well-calibrated prognostic model with an overall c-index score of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.795–0.805) on the representative out-held test set. The simulation study revealed that the suggestions for the follow-up duration covered the minimum duration and differed by the tumor dissemination stages and affected organs. Time points with a high likelihood for risk stability were identifiable. Conclusions: A personalized temporal survival estimation is feasible using artificial intelligence and has potential application in clinical settings, including surveillance management.">

        <tr id="47 Background: Prostate cancer represents a significant economic burden for health systems; the identification of risk factors that allows the identification of subgroups of patients that require closer follow-up or more intense therapeutic regimens has a direct impact on the prognosis and expenses for the patient, there is currently great interest in patients with high-volume mHSPC, this group is defined according to the number of lesions and their location, this could represent a challenge in decision making due to the variety of presentations regarding tumor burden, currently with the development of AI algorithms it is possible to estimate the PSMA TTB by identifying patients who are candidates for specific therapies without exposing them to comorbidities associated to aggressive regimens. Methods: Baseline PSMA PET scans of patients with histopathological corroborated diagnosis of prostate cancer and considered as high volume according to 68Ga PSMA PET/CT imaging in the period from October 2017 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using an automated algorithm to estimate PSMA TTB, the median follow-up was of 44 +/- 9.7 months. These patients were divided into two groups according to the optimal cutoff values of PSMA TTB and estimate progression-free survival after initial therapy with Kaplan-Meier curves and correlation index between tumor burden and prostatic specific antigen. Results: 53 patients with a mean age of 71 years (+/- 5.1) were included, 17 with Gleason 7 (4+3/3+4), 18; G8 (4+4), 15; G9 (5+4/4+5) and 3; G10 (5+5), ISUP group 3 (n=17), group 4 (n=18) group 5 (n=18), the mean PSA value at diagnosis was 62.1 ng/dL (range 25.2- 201.5). PSMA TTB mean was 100.1cm3 (range 21cm3- 518.8 cm3). Log-rank test revealed that PSMA TTB lower than 45 cm3 (n=21) presented higher time of progression-free survival in comparison with patients with PSMA TTB higher than 45 cm3 (n=32) (31.1 mo vs 47.8 mo, p <0.003). TTB and PSA demonstrated a significant correlation (Pearson r= 0.526, p< 0.0001). There was no difference between groups of low and high PSMA TTB and ISUP groups or Gleason score. Sites of visceral disease were lung (n=11), (pleura=9) liver (n=9), adrenal, (n=5) brain, (n=2), and sites of extra spinal and pelvic disease were ribs (n=24) femur (n=16), skull (n=8), scapula (n=7), humerus (n=7). All patients had one or more lesions at previously described sites. Conclusions: PSMA TTB has great value in predicting progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed high-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and has a strong correlation with PSA, strengthening the role of next-generation molecular imaging with PSMA PET as an invaluable tool in initial diagnosis and potentially in follow-up by providing information on the biological behavior of the disease in a systemic way.">

 Identification of prognosis changing events is essential during cancer surveillance. Current clinical practice is limited by “one-size-fits-all” time management or subjective assessment that is not necessarily appropriate for individual patients’ risk profiles. A risk-adapted follow-up is more efficient and optimal from the clinical perspective. Herein we introduce an artificial intelligence-based data-driven solution for risk-adapted follow-up schedule that devises the number of follow-up visits per year and assesses the cancer-specific risk profile over a long interval depending on the age at diagnosis. We utilized Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), a cancer registry database and a resource for cancer-specific survival estimation in the United States that includes more than 2 million patients diagnosed with urologic cancers. We tested different machine learning algorithms on their definition for the feature importance and selected clinically relevant parameters regularly used in clinical routine to develop a survival modeling. As a result, the underlying recurrent neural network algorithm for follow-up modeling was fitted on the unseen test set with an overall concordance index score of 0.80. A controlled access to the online tool is available for physicians.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The primary purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms used in the field of prostate cancer (PC) for diagnosis and treatment. This review aims to show the research community that AI-enabled technologies have the potential for widespread growth and penetration of PC diagnostics and therapeutics to simplify and accelerate existing healthcare processes. Abstract As medical science and technology progress towards the era of “big data”, a multi-dimensional dataset pertaining to medical diagnosis and treatment is becoming accessible for mathematical modelling. However, these datasets are frequently inconsistent, noisy, and often characterized by a significant degree of redundancy. Thus, extensive data processing is widely advised to clean the dataset before feeding it into the mathematical model. In this context, Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their types, are being used to produce a precise and cross-sectional illustration of clinical data. For prostate cancer patients, datasets derived from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), MRI-guided biopsies, genetic biomarkers, and the Gleason grading are primarily used for diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient monitoring. However, recording diagnoses and further stratifying risks based on such diagnostic data frequently involves much subjectivity. Thus, implementing an AI algorithm on a PC’s diagnostic data can reduce the subjectivity of the process and assist in decision making. In addition, AI is used to cut down the processing time and help with early detection, which provides a superior outcome in critical cases of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this also facilitates offering the service at a lower cost by reducing the amount of human labor. Herein, the prime objective of this review is to provide a deep analysis encompassing the existing AI algorithms that are being deployed in the field of prostate cancer (PC) for diagnosis and treatment. Based on the available literature, AI-powered technology has the potential for extensive growth and penetration in PC diagnosis and treatment to ease and expedite the existing medical process.">

        <tr id="Standard-of-care treatment regimes have long been designed to for maximal cell kill, yet these strategies often fail when applied to treatment–resistant tumors, resulting in patient relapse. Adaptive treatment strategies have been developed as an alternative approach, harnessing intra-tumoral competition to suppress the growth of treatment resistant populations, to delay or even prevent tumor progression. Following recent clinical implementations of adaptive therapy, it is of significant interest to optimise adaptive treatment protocols. We propose the application of deep reinforcement learning models to provide generalised solutions within adaptive drug scheduling, and demonstrate this framework can outperform the current adaptive protocols, extending time to progression by up to a quarter. This strategy is robust to varying model parameterisations, and the underlying tumor model. We demonstrate the deep learning framework can produce interpretable, adaptive strategies based on a single tumor burden threshold, replicating and informing a novel, analytically–derived optimal treatment strategy with no knowledge of the underlying mathematical tumor model. This approach is highly relevant beyond the simple, analytically–tractable tumor model considered here, demonstrating the capability of deep learning frameworks to help inform and develop treatment strategies in complex settings. Finally, we propose a pathway to integrate mechanistic modelling with DRL to tailor generalist treatment strategies to individual patients in the clinic, generating personalised treatment schedules that consistently outperform clinical standard-of-care protocols.">

        <tr id="The replacement of the natural hip with artificial components is a well established procedure in orthopaedic medicine to alleviate pain from the diseased joint. The total hip replacement (THR) consists of a femoral component or stem and an acetabular cup. These are made as either one piece or modular designs. Modular femoral components have become popular among surgeons because neck length and offset can be adjusted intraoperatively, providing increased versatility without any need for a large inventory. In addition, modular heads allow for mixed alloy systems such as the combination of a titanium alloy stem with a cobalt-chromium or ceramic head. Apart from the neck/head connection, there are femoral stem designs with extra areas of modularity. Examples of these prostheses are the S-ROM (Joint Medical Products, Stanford, Connecticut), the Infinity (Dow Corning Wright, Memphis, Tennessee), the RHMS (SmithNephew Richards, Memphis, Tennessee), and PROFEMUR Hip System (Wright Cremascoli Ortho SA, France). A major drawback for all modular orthopaedic devices is that each modular component interface becomes a potential site for corrosion, wear, fretting and fatigue of mating surfaces (Collier et al., 1992; Manley & Serekian 1994; Hallab & Jacobs, 2003; Goldberg & Gilbert, 2003; Hallab et al., 2004; Gilbert et al., 2009; Rodrigues et al., 2009). The products of these interface processes are believed to cause tissue reactions that lead to implant loosening and subsequent failure of the arthroplasty (Amstutz et al., 1992; Harris, 1994; Kraft et al., 2001; Goldberg et al., 2002). Thus, to make implant designs successful in clinical applications, these concerns need to be adequately addressed during the design stage of the prosthesis in conjunction with the implant strength and integrity of the implant-host bone system. Types of failures often encountered in modular hip implants are dissociation, corrosion, wear; fretting and fatigue of mating metal surfaces (Goldberg et al., 2002, Sporer et al., 2006; Rodrigues et al., 2009). There are varieties of design and material factors that may influence the failure of specific components. The most significant of these is fretting because is almost impossible to prevent and in many cases may lead to other form of failures. 8">

        <tr id="Multi-objective optimization (MO) is a highly demanding research topic because many realworld optimization problems consist of contradictory criteria or objectives. Considering these competing objectives concurrently, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) can be formulated as finding the best possible solutions that satisfy these objectives under different tradeoff situations. A family of solutions in the feasible solution space forms a Pareto-optimal front, which describes the tradeoff among several contradictory objectives of an MOP. Generally, there are two goals in finding the Pareto-optimal front of a MOP: 1) to converge solutions as near as possible to the Pareto-optimal front; and 2) to distribute solutions as diverse as possible over the obtained non-dominated front. These two goals cause enormous search space in MOPs and let deterministic algorithms feel difficult to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. Therefore, satisfying these two goals simultaneously is a principal challenge for any algorithm to deal with MOPs (Dias & Vasconcelos, 2002). In recent years, several evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proposed to solve MOPs. For example, the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) (Zitzler et al., 2000) and the revised non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) (Deb et al., 2002) are two most famous algorithms. Several extensions of genetic algorithms (GAs) for dealing with MOPs are also proposed, such as the niche Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) (Horn et al., 1994), the chaos-genetic algorithm (CGA) (Qi et al., 2006), and the real jumping gene genetic algorithm (RJGGA) (Ripon et al., 2007). However, most existing GAs only evaluate each chromosome by its fitness value regardless of the schema structure, which is a gene pattern defined by fixing the values of specific gene loci within a chromosome. The schemata theorem proved by Goldberg in 1989 is a central result of GA’s theory in which a larger of effective genomes implies a more efficient of searching ability for a GA (Goldberg, 1989). Inspired by the outstanding literature of Kalyanmoy Deb, this study proposes an evaluative crossover operator to incorporate with the original NSGA-II. The proposed evaluative version of NSGA-II, named E-NSGA-II, can further enhance the advantages of the fast nondominated sorting and the diversity preservation of the NSGA-II for improving the quality of the Pareto-optimal solutions in MOPs. The proposed evaluative crossover imitates the gene-therapy process at the forefront of medicine and therefore integrates a new gene6">

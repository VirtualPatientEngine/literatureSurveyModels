        <tr id="The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23, 2020, was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.">

        <tr id="With the large-scale outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, scientists and medical workers around the world made contributions to reducing the epidemic outbreak, curing patients, and developing vaccines against the epidemic. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in various countries, many scholars have used machine learning and infectious disease dynamics models to make corresponding predictions for the subsequent development of the epidemic. In order to acquire a more accurate forecast of the global epidemic, this paper used the ARIMA model, Logistic model, SIR model, and improved SEIR model to make predictions. Moreover, we compared these models’ benefits, drawbacks, and the degree of fit between the predicted data of various models and the real data to obtain a highly accurate model. Experiments have proved that among these models, the improved SEIR model can predict the future development trend of the global epidemic more precisely. In addition, the improved SEIR model also provides a certain theoretical basis for the government to issue a series of policies, prevention methods and control measures.">

        <tr id="Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks. Interpretation: The COVID-19 outbreak is controllable in the foreseeable future if comprehensive and stringent control measures are taken.">

 Initially found at Hubei, Wuhan and identified as a novel virus of coronavirus family by WHO, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with an exponentially speed, causing millions of death and public fear. Currently, COVID19 has brought a secondary wave within U.S., India, Brazil and other parts of the world. However, its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear from the medical, mathematical and pharmaceutical aspects. Classical Suspect-Infection-Recovery model has limitations to describe the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it becomes necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infected cases in U.S. In this article, a dynamic model called RLIM based on classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections with a dynamic secondary infection rate ω in assumption. An intermediate state called SI is introduced between recovery and infection statues to record the number of secondary infected cases from a latent period of recovery. Compared with other models, RLIM fits historical recovery cases and utilizes them to predict future infections. Because RLIM utilizes multiple information sources, and provides error back propagation schematics, it is reasonable to assert that its predictions are more accurate and persuasive. Projections of four U.S. COVID19 states show that with the secondary infectious rate ω varies from 0.01 to 0.3 within a latent period of 14 days chosen, RLIM can predict the newly infected number from January 15 to February 15, 2021 with AFER lower to 14%. It also successfully estimates the turning point of New Yorks infections in January 2021, based on current data records.">

Meanwhile, an economic crisis and resistance to the strict intervention measures are rising. Some researchers proposed intermittent social distancing that may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022. Questions arise about whether we should maintain or relax quarantine measures. We developed novel artificial intelligence and causal inference integrated methods for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear epidemic systems. We estimated that the peak time of the Covid-19 in the US would be April 24, 2020 and its outbreak in the US will be over by the end of July and reach 1,551,901 cases. We evaluated the impact of relaxing the current interventions for reopening economy on the spread of Covid-19. We provide tools for balancing the risks of workers and reopening economy.">

        <tr id="In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to R(t) 1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.">

One of the major obstacles for making accurate predictions is imperfect available data on the current state of the disease dynamics typically summarized via the number of infected and recovered cases, and disease-related deaths. In the case of rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, major challenges include under-reporting of infected and recovered cases due to the shortage of available tests, non-uniform performance and not suﬃciently high sensitivity/speciﬁcity of currently available tests, a long incubation period, and a signiﬁcant number of asymptomatic/unconﬁrmed cases, inconsistent accounting practices in death classiﬁcation.

Modeling of COVID-19 data is of great importance, because it can provide insight into the dynamics of the spread of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes the COVID disease, and the eﬀects of mitigation policies. Such insight is helpful for health workers and policy makers to evaluate potential interventions and make forecast about the future trend of the virus spread. This is exactly the aim of Wang et al.

Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data. On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.">

        <tr id="Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.">

To this effect, we applied SusceptibleInfectiveRecovered/Removed (SIR) epidemiological model on the disease. Additionally, we used the Machine Learning linear regression model on the historical COVID-19 data to predict the earlier stage of the disease. The evolution of the disease spread with the Mathematical SIR model and Machine Learning regression model for time series forecasting of the COVID-19 data without, and with lags and trends, was able to capture the early spread of the disease. Consequently, we suggest that if using a more advanced epidemiological model, and sophisticated machine learning regression models on the COVID-19 data, we can understand, as well as predict the long time evolution of the disease spread.">

Using the present COVID-19 pandemic as a guide, the researchers suggest a hybrid model architecture for analyzing and optimizing COVID-19 data during the complete country. The analysis of COVID-19's exploration and death rate uses an ARIMA model with susceptible-infectious-removed and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models. The logistic model's failure to forecast the number of confirmed diagnoses and the snags of the SEIR model's too many tuning parameters are both addressed by a hybrid model method. Logistic regression (LR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are utilized for the same purpose. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error are used to show these models. New COVID-19 cases, the number of quarantines, mortality rates, and the deployment of public self-protection measures to reduce the epidemic are all outlined in the study's findings.

While over a million of literature have been produced on these unprecedented, overwhelming global disaster, one critical question is open: How has COVID-19 been quantified globally? This further inspires many other questions: What COVID-19 problems have been modeled? How have modeling methods in areas such as epidemiology, artificial intelligence (AI), data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science played their roles in characterizing COVID-19? Where are the gaps and issues of these COVID-19 modeling studies? What are the lessons for quantifying future disasters? Answering these questions involves the analysis of a very broad spectrum of literature across different disciplines and domains. Distinguishing from specific efforts, this review takes the first attempt to generate a systematic, structured and contrastive landscape and taxonomy of global COVID-19 modeling. First, the surveyed problems span over a full range of COVID-19, including epidemic transmission processes, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions and their influence, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. Second, the reviewed modeling methods traverse all relevant disciplines, from statistic modeling to epidemic modeling, medical analysis, biomedical analysis, AI, deep and machine learning, analytics, and simulation. Critical analyses further identify significant issues and gaps, for example, simple techniques and similar problems have been overwhelmingly addressed everywhere, while intrinsic and foundational issues and deep insights have been overlooked. The review discloses significant opportunities for more deeply, effectively and uniquely quantifying COVID-19-like global disasters from their intrinsic working mechanisms, interactions and dynamics.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Following the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared this infectious disease as a pandemic. Unlike previous infectious outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome (MERS), the high transmission rate of COVID-19 has resulted in worldwide spread. The countries with the highest recorded incidence and mortality rates are the US and UK. 
Rationale/Objective: This review will compare studies that have used epidemiological models for disease forecasting and other models that have identified sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19. We will evaluate several models, from basic equation-based mathematical models to more advanced machine-learning ones. Our expectation is that by identifying high impact models used by policy makers and discussing their limitations, we can identify possible areas for future research. 
Evidence Review: The bibliographic database google scholar was used to search keywords such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘epidemiological modelling’ and ‘machine learning’. We examined data review articles, research studies and government-released articles. 
Results: We identified that the current SEIR model used by the UK government lacked the spatial modelling to enable an accurate prediction of disease spread. We discussed that machine-learning systems which can identify high-risk groups can be used to establish the disparities in COVID-19 death in BAME groups. We found that most of the data hungry AI models used were limited by the lack of datasets available. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, advances in AI methods for infectious disease have overcome challenges presented in mathematical models. Whilst limitations do exist, when optimised, these highly advanced models have a great potential in public health surveillance, particularly infectious disease transmission.">

In this paper, we propose a SEIR-C epidemic transmission trend prediction model, which improves the traditional SEIR infectious disease model and combines it with the GRU model, and experiments show that the model has better results in epidemic transmission prediction. The paper also analyses the situation of isolation measures and vaccines in epidemic prevention and control, providing some reference for the formulation of epidemic prevention and control policies.">

In order to find out a better way to predict and forecast the epidemic situation, this paper utilized machine learning and a series of regressions, including linear regression, polynomial regression, multi-regression, and Lasso regression models. In addition, in order to improve the accuracy, this paper focused on the cumulative features. With employing the algorithm mentioned above, this paper tried to find out the model that fits the training data by calculating the mean square error (MSE) or coefficient of determination (R}}2) to evaluate the models. The data were divided into three temporal portions and fit into the model to make the result more accurate. What’s more, for states data, they are divided into different categories and added with the Time-Lag matrix. The features are selected at the same time. The result demonstrates that multi-linear regression and multi-polynomial regression are considerable suitable to fit the model and to predict the COVID-19 epidemic. We hope our findings can serve as a valuable reference to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic situation.">

        <tr id="Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.">

To develop the artificial intelligence (AI) inspired methods for real-time forecasting and evaluating intervention strategies to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the World. A modified auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics is developed and applied to the surveillance data of cumulative and new Covid-19 cases and deaths from WHO, as of March 16, 2020. The average errors of 5-step forecasting were 2.5%. The total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with later intervention (comprehensive public health intervention is implemented 4 weeks later) could reach 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively. The case ending time was January 10, 2021. However, the total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with one week later intervention were reduced to 951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the Covid-19 spread would be reduced from 356 days to 232 days. The case ending time was September 8, 2020. We observed that delaying intervention for one month caused the maximum number of cumulative cases to increase 166.89 times, and the number of deaths increase from 53,560 to 8,938,725.

After statistical testing, the ARIMA model and the improved ARIMAX model based on feature selection quickly solves the development trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the short-term;Result: The implementation of the computer program shows that the traditional ARIMAmodel cannot predict the cumulative number of COVID-19 diagnoses in the United States well, and the improved ARIMAX model using features based on stepwise regression can accurately predict the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States under the 95% confidence interval. The U.S. epidemic will show a clear upward trend in the next 60 days, and in mid-March the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses in the country is about 3,724,000, and the cumulative death toll is about 476,000, and the number of people in the ICU ward is about 22,118. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

It has claimed more than 50,000 lives worldwide and more than one million of people have been infected as of 04th April 2020. In Sri Lanka, the first case of COVI19 was reported late January 2020 was a Chinese national and the first local case was identified in the second week of March. Since then, the government of Sri Lanka introduced various sequential measures to improve social distancing such as closure of schools and education institutes, introducing work from home model to reduce the public gathering, introducing travel bans to international arrivals and more drastically, imposed island wide curfew expecting to minimize the burden of the disease to the Sri Lankan health system and the entire community. Currently, there are 159 cases with five fatalities and also reported that 24 patients are recovered and discharged from hospitals. In this study, we use the SEIR conceptual model and its modified version by decomposing infected patients into two classes; patients who show mild symptoms and patients who tend to face severe respiratory problems and are required to treat in intensive care units. We numerically simulate the models for about five months period considering three critical parameters of COVID transmission mainly in the Sri Lankan context; efficacy of control measures, rate of overseas imported cases and time to introduce social distancing measures by the respective authorities.">

This modified SEIR model was applied on the available initial spread data until June 25th, 2021 for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Without lockdown in Jordan, the analysis demonstrates potential infection to roughly 3.1 million people during the peak of spread approximately 3 months, starting from the date of lockdown (March 21st). Conversely, the present partial lockdowns strategy by the Kingdom was expected to reduce the predicted number of infections to 0.5 million in 9 months period. The analysis also demonstrates the ability of stricter lockdowns to effectively flatten the graph curve of COVID-19 in Jordan. Our modified SEIR and deep neural network (DNN) model were efficient in the prediction of COVID-19 epidemic sizes and peaks. The measures taken to control the epidemic by the government decreased the size of the COVID-19 epidemic.">

 BACKGROUND
 The COVID-19 pendemic reached more than 200 countries, which was recognized during December-19 from CHINA and affected more than 28 lakh people on date April 26, 2020 (data source:Johns Hopkins Corona Virus Resource Center).
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until July 2, 2020) using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA).
 
 
 METHODS
 Here we have used the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Mathematical approaches are widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and parameters of COVID-19. Methods such as epidemic curve fitting, surveillance data during the early transmission R0, and other epidemic models are frequently applied to generate forecasts of COVID-19 pandemic across the world.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Our analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran, entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) is come as a surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed at global level and extracted data upon Machine Learning approach using Artificial intelligence techniques for top 10% or 20 countries.

There are countless people affected and reported cases are increasing day by day. Predictive models need to consider previous reported cases and forecast the upcoming number of cases. Automatic ARIMA, one of the predictive models used for forecasting contagions, was used in this study to predict the number of confirmed cases for next 10 days in four top European countries through R package “forecast”. The study finds that Auto ARIMA applied on the sample satisfactorily forecasts the confirmed cases of coronavirus for next ten days. The confirmed cases for the four countries show an increasing trend for the next ten days with Spain with a highest number of expected new confirmed cases, followed by Germany and France. Italy is expected to have lowest number of new confirmed cases among the four countries. Significance for public health World Health Organization (WHO) and medical authorities all over the world and specially in the European countries are busy in taking appropriate measures against COVID-19. It is important to do proper planning and the success is dependent on the arrangements that will be made in near future to stop the spread of this disease. This study by prediction of upcoming cases will help the authorities to plan accordingly, i.e. to arrange appropriate number of medical facilities. Similar approximations for other parts of the world can be made following the methodology used in this paper and better medical arrangements can be ensured. Overall, such kind of research play an important role for policy making and making task forces to combat against epidemics.">

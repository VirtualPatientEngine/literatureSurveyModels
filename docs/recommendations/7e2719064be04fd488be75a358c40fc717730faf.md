        <tr id="This paper reports on the development of a model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that takes into account a comprehensive mitigation protocol. This is necessary for public health decision support and making actionable recommendations on COVID-19 response. The comprehensive mitigation protocol includes (1) personal protection and social distancing, (2) use of smart applications for symptom reporting and contact tracing, (3) targeted testing based on identification of individuals with possible exposure and/or infection via symptom reporting and contact tracing, (4) surveillance testing, and (5) shelter, quarantine and isolation procedures. The proposed model (1) extends a common epidemiological discrete dynamic model with the comprehensive mitigation protocol, (2) uses Bayesian probability analysis to estimate the conditional probabilities of being in non-circulating epidemiological sub-compartments as a function of the mitigation protocol parameters, based on which it (3) estimates transition ratios among the compartments, and (4) computes a range of key performance indicators including health outcomes, mitigation cost and productivity loss. The proposed model can serve as a critical component for COVID-19 mitigation decision support and recommender systems, as part of a broader effort to support urgent pandemic response.">

Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 is its Python interface, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.">

        <tr id="Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by a large number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are difficult to detect; most of them remain unknown, still having an important role in the transmission of the disease, this make the pan- demic difficult to control. The purpose of this research is to develop an epidemi- ological model that allow to estimate the number of unknown/asymptomatic cases in a given area. The SEIAMPR system, a novel simulation based model for COVID-19 is designed and implemented in Python. The intuition of the model is simple: about 80% of COVID-19 infected people evolve as asymptomatic or with a mild clinical course, many of them remain unknown to the authorities, some of them including those in critical conditions are eventually detected and classified as positive cases. The simulator reproduces this process using an adaptive method integrated with official data. The simulator has been used for modelling the outbreak in 21 regions in Italy. The positive effects of lockdown policies are demonstrated: unknown ac- tive cases 12 days after the lockdown (March the 21th) ranged from 284101 to 374038, e.g. many more than all the official cases in Italy, reducing to 10213/20949 the reopening day. The number of unknown active cases at the beginning of June in the Lombardia region ranged from 6813 to 13390 de- manding particular attention. SEIAMPR is simple to tune and integrate with official data, it emerges as an up-and-coming tool for reporting the effect of lockdown measures, the impact of the disease on the population, and the remaining unknown active cases for evaluating the timing of exit strategies.">

Many questions emerge, a critical one is to quantify the challenges, realities, intervention effect and influence of the pandemic. With the massive effort in modeling COVID-19, what COVID-19 issues have been modeled? what and how well have epidemiology, AI, data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science characterized the COVID-19 epidemic? what are the gaps and opportunities of quantifying the pandemic? Such questions involve a wide body of knowledge and literature, unclear but important for the present and future health crisis quantification. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the challenges, tasks, methods, progress, gaps and opportunities in relation to modeling COVID-19 processes, data, mitigation and impact. With a research landscape of COVID-19 modeling, we further categorize, summarize, compare and discuss the related methods and progress of modeling COVID-19 epidemic transmission processes and dynamics, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, nonpharmaceutical interventions and their effects, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. The review shows how modeling methods such as mathematical and statistical models, domain-driven modeling by epidemiological compartmental models, medical and biomedical analysis, AI and data science in particular shallow and deep machine learning, simulation modeling, social science methods and hybrid modeling have addressed the COVID-19 challenges and what gaps and directions exist for better futures.">

        <tr id="Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the whole world has taken interest in the mechanisms of its spread and development. Mathematical models have been valuable instruments for the study of the spread and control of infectious diseases. For that purpose, we propose a two-way approach in modeling COVID-19 spread: a susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased (SEIRD) model based on differential equations and a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The SEIRD model is a compartmental epidemiological model with included components: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased. In the case of the SEIRD model, official statistical data available online for countries of Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg (Benelux) in the period of March 15 2020 to March 15 2021 were used. Based on them, we have calculated key parameters and forward them to the epidemiological model, which will predict the number of infected, deceased, and recovered people. Results show that the SEIRD model is able to accurately predict several peaks for all the three countries of interest, with very small root mean square error (RMSE), except for the mild cases (maximum RMSE was 240.79 ± 90.556), which can be explained by the fact that no official data were available for mild cases, but this number was derived from other statistics. On the other hand, LSTM represents a special kind of recurrent neural network structure that can comparatively learn long-term temporal dependencies. Results show that LSTM is capable of predicting several peaks based on the position of previous peaks with low values of RMSE. Higher values of RMSE are observed in the number of infected cases in Belgium (RMSE was 535.93) and Netherlands (RMSE was 434.28), and are expected because of thousands of people getting infected per day in those countries. In future studies, we will extend the models to include mobility information, variants of concern, as well as a medical intervention, etc. A prognostic model could help us predict epidemic peaks. In that way, we could react in a timely manner by introducing new or tightening existing measures before the health system is overloaded.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 infection cases have surged globally, causing devastations to both the society and economy. A key factor contributing to the sustained spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden spreaders, who mix among the susceptible population without being detected or quarantined. Here we propose an effective non-pharmacological intervention method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading network in Singapore. We find that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19 can be identified with remarkable accuracy. Specifically, based on the unique characteristics of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious states in a network, and extend it to an efficient algorithm to identify asymptotic individuals. Our simulation results indicate that a screening method using our prediction outperforms machine learning algorithms, e.g. graph neural networks, that are designed as baselines in this work, as well as random screening of infection's closest contacts widely used by China in its early outbreak. Furthermore, our method provides high precision even with incomplete information of the contract-tracing networks. Our work can be of critical importance to the non-pharmacological interventions of COVID-19, especially with increasing adoptions of contact tracing measures using various new technologies. Beyond COVID-19, our framework can be useful for other epidemic diseases that also feature asymptomatic spreading">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 viruses and their triggered COVID-19 pandemic have fundamentally reshaped the world in almost every aspect, their evolution and influences remain. While over a million of literature have been produced on these unprecedented, overwhelming global disaster, one critical question is open: How has COVID-19 been quantified globally? This further inspires many other questions: What COVID-19 problems have been modeled? How have modeling methods in areas such as epidemiology, artificial intelligence (AI), data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science played their roles in characterizing COVID-19? Where are the gaps and issues of these COVID-19 modeling studies? What are the lessons for quantifying future disasters? Answering these questions involves the analysis of a very broad spectrum of literature across different disciplines and domains. Distinguishing from specific efforts, this review takes the first attempt to generate a systematic, structured and contrastive landscape and taxonomy of global COVID-19 modeling. First, the surveyed problems span over a full range of COVID-19, including epidemic transmission processes, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions and their influence, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. Second, the reviewed modeling methods traverse all relevant disciplines, from statistic modeling to epidemic modeling, medical analysis, biomedical analysis, AI, deep and machine learning, analytics, and simulation. Critical analyses further identify significant issues and gaps, for example, simple techniques and similar problems have been overwhelmingly addressed everywhere, while intrinsic and foundational issues and deep insights have been overlooked. The review discloses significant opportunities for more deeply, effectively and uniquely quantifying COVID-19-like global disasters from their intrinsic working mechanisms, interactions and dynamics.">

Every preventive measure is modeled based on an equivalent actual event and every essential aspect that affects the course of the pandemic. A person is represented as a circle moving freely in two-dimensional space, and disease spreads through person-to-person contact. This simulator then tested using parameters to simulate COVID-19 and found significant results between communities that implement preventive measures and those that do not. We found that within 106 days, 284 people were infected, but when five preventive methods are applied for a total of 33 days, only 31 people were infected. Adequate to simulate epidemic events and their prevention measures, this simulator can also be used as a learning tool with factors in epidemic events such as population density, mobility, infection rate, disease mortality, and every effect of each preventive measure.

        <tr id="In the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, public health strategies tend to gravitate towards non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) given the time required to develop targeted treatments and vaccines. One of the most common NPIs is Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI). One of the factors determining the effectiveness of TTI is the ability to identify contacts of infected individuals. In this study, we propose a multi-layer temporal contact network to model transmission dynamics and assess the impact of different TTI implementations, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. The model was used to evaluate TTI effectiveness both in containing an outbreak and mitigating the impact of an epidemic. We estimated that a TTI strategy based on home isolation and testing of both primary and secondary contacts can contain outbreaks only when the reproduction number is up to 1.3, at which the epidemic prevention potential is 88.2% (95% CI: 87.9%-88.5%). On the other hand, for higher value of the reproduction number, TTI is estimated to noticeably mitigate disease burden but at high social costs (e.g., over a month in isolation/quarantine per person for reproduction numbers of 1.7 or higher). We estimated that strategies considering quarantine of contacts have a larger epidemic prevention potential than strategies that either avoid tracing contacts or require contacts to be tested before isolation. Combining TTI with other social distancing measures can improve the likelihood of successfully containing an outbreak but the estimated epidemic prevention potential remains lower than 50% for reproduction numbers higher than 2.1.">

        <tr id="Background Throughout March 2020, leaders in countries across the world were making crucial decisions about how and when to implement public health interventions to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). They urgently needed tools to help them to explore what will work best in their specific circumstances of epidemic size and spread, and feasible intervention scenarios. Objective We sought to rapidly develop a flexible, freely available simulation model for use by modelers and researchers to allow investigation of how various public health interventions implemented at various time points might change the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Methods “COVOID” (COVID-19 Open-Source Infection Dynamics) is a stochastic individual contact model (ICM), which extends the ICMs provided by the open-source EpiModel package for the R statistical computing environment. To demonstrate its use and inform urgent decisions on March 30, 2020, we modeled similar intervention scenarios to those reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as novel scenarios. The scenarios involved isolation of cases, moderate social distancing, and stricter population “lockdowns” enacted over varying time periods in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people. On April 30, 2020, we simulated the epidemic curve for the three contiguous local areas (population 287,344) in eastern Sydney, Australia that recorded 5.3% of Australian cases of COVID-19 through to April 30, 2020, under five different intervention scenarios and compared the modeled predictions with the observed epidemic curve for these areas. Results COVOID allocates each member of a population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID on March 30, 2020, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by others. The simulated curve for three local areas of Sydney from March 1 to April 30, 2020, was similar to the observed epidemic curve in terms of peak numbers of cases, total numbers of cases, and duration under a scenario representing the public health measures that were actually enacted, including case isolation and ramp-up of testing and social distancing measures. Conclusions COVOID allows rapid modeling of many potential intervention scenarios, can be tailored to diverse settings, and requires only standard computing infrastructure. It replicates the epidemic curves produced by other models that require highly detailed population-level data, and its predicted epidemic curve, using parameters simulating the public health measures that were enacted, was similar in form to that actually observed in Sydney, Australia. Our team and collaborators are currently developing an extended open-source COVOID package comprising of a suite of tools to explore intervention scenarios using several categories of models.">

        <tr id="With the ongoing evolution of the novel coronavirus pathogen and continuous improvements in our social environment, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is on a decline. In response to this, we introduce an adaptive control strategy known as intentional control, which offers cost-efficiency and superior control effectiveness. The classical SEIR model faces limitations in accurately representing close contacts and sub-close contacts and fails to distinguish their varying levels of infectivity. To address this, our study modifies the classical model by incorporating close contact (E) and a sub-close contact (E2) while reworking the infectious mechanism. Once the model is formulated, we employ various statistical methods to identify crucial parameters, including R 2, adjusted R 2, and standard deviation. For disease control, we implement an intentional control program with four distinct grades. We develop and apply a scheme in MATLAB for our proposed model, generating diverse simulation results based on realistic parameter values for discussion. Additionally, we explore a range of strategy combinations to differentiate their effectiveness under various social conditions, aiming to identify an optimal approach. Comparing the intentional control strategy to random control, our findings consistently demonstrate the superiority of intentional control across all scenarios. Furthermore, the results indicate that our approach better aligns with the characteristics of the novel coronavirus, characterized by an “extremely low fatality rate and strong infectivity,” while offering detailed insights into the transmission dynamics among different compartments.">

        <tr id="The conversion rate between asymptomatic infections and reported/unreported symptomatic infections is a very sensitive parameter for model variables that spread COVID-19. This is important information for follow-up use in screening, prediction, prognostics, contact tracing, and drug development for the COVID-19 pandemic. The model described here suggests that there may not be enough researchers to solve all of these problems thoroughly and effectively, and it requires careful selection of what we are doing and rapid sharing of results and models and optimizing modeling simulations with value to reduce the impact of COVID-19. Exploring simulation modeling will help decision makers make the most informed decisions. In order to fight against the “Delta” virus, the establishment of a line of defense through all-people testing (APT) is not only an effective method summarized from past experience but also one of the best means to effectively cut the chain of epidemic transmission. The effect of large-scale testing has been fully verified in the international community. We developed a practical dynamic infectious disease model-SETPG (A + I) RD + APT by considering the effects of the all-people test (APT). The model is useful for studying effects of screening measures and providing a more realistic modelling with all-people-test strategies, which require everybody in a population to be tested for infection. In prior work, a total of 370 epidemic cases were collected. We collected three kinds of known cases: the cumulative number of daily incidences, daily cumulative recovery, and daily cumulative deaths in Hong Kong and the United States between 22 January 2020 and 13 November 2020 were simulated. In two essential strategies of the integrated SETPG (A + I) RD + APT model, comparing the cumulative number of screenings in derivative experiments based on daily detection capability and tracking system application rate, we evaluated the performance of the timespan required for the basic regeneration number (R0) and real-time regeneration number (R0t) to reach 1; the optimal policy of each experiment is available, and the screening effect is evaluated by screening performance indicators. with the binary encoding screening method, the number of screenings for the target population is 8667 in HK and 1,803,400 in the U.S., including 6067 asymptomatic cases in HK and 1,262,380 in the U.S. as well as 2599 cases of mild symptoms in HK and 541,020 in the U.S.; there were also 8.25 days of screening timespan in HK and 9.25 days of screening timespan required in the U.S. and a daily detectability of 625,000 cases in HK and 6,050,000 cases in the U.S. Using precise tracking technology, number of screenings for the target population is 6060 cases in HK and 1,766,420 cases in the U.S., including 4242 asymptomatic cases in HK and 1,236,494 cases in the U.S. as well as 1818 cases of mild symptoms in HK and 529,926 cases in the U.S. Total screening timespan (TS) is 8.25~9.25 days. According to the proposed infectious dynamics model that adapts to the all-people test, all of the epidemic cases were reported for fitting, and the result seemed more reasonable, and epidemic prediction became more accurate. It adapted to densely populated metropolises for APT on prevention.">

 BACKGROUND
 Early efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic have been focused on Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) in the absence of effective treatments or sufficient vaccine supply. While retrospective analyses and modeling studies confirmed that severe restrictions of social contacts, i.e., lockdowns, are most effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they incur large economic costs and mental health risks. Earlier detection of cases has also been proposed as an effective method of control, but studies have so far only considered enhanced laboratory testing. Digital applications have been developed which aim to identify possible cases of COVID-19 based on reported symptoms and risk factors.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 The aim of this study is to explore the effects of digital screening applications for COVID-19 on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
 
 
 METHODS
 Using an established epidemiological Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model for infectious disease transmission, we simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, the UK, and the USA for 366 days after the virus was introduced in the population. We study 4 scenarios: 1) no interventions (base case), 2) symptom-based self-isolation after consulting healthcare providers, 3) self-isolation using digital screening applications, and 4) severe social contact limitations (lockdown). We included sensitivity analyses for different ratios of infectiousness of pre-symptomatic cases compared to symptomatic cases, and different rates of adoption of digital screening tools.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Without any intervention, 74% of the German population would be infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the simulation period (UK: 76%, USA: 77%). Self-isolation of symptomatic cases would already slow the spread of the virus significantly and lead to only 18% of the German population being infected (UK: 17%, USA: 17%). Using a digital application could further reduce the infected population to 10% (UK: 9%, USA: 9%), compared to 3% under lockdown conditions. While the effectiveness of digital screening applications varies with the adoption rate, even a low adoption rate could significantly reduce transmission. In the case that pre-symptomatic cases are less infectious than symptomatic cases, the overall proportion of infected individuals in the population decreases, and the effectiveness of different interventions converges.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 Digital symptom-based screening tools can substantially impact the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and might be a viable element in strategies to control COVID-19 through NPIs.

        <tr id="Agent-based models have proven to be useful tools in supporting decision-making processes in different application domains. The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes. In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high. Furthermore, we found that quarantine length is more important than quarantine efficiency but that, with sufficient symptomatic control, also short quarantines can have a substantial effect.">

Several scenarios are simulated using the most common vaccines available in Brazil. On each scenario, different fractions of the population are affected by vaccination and social distancing measures.

Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, hygiene measures, and protective equipment; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors.

In the absence of previous experience with this new disease, public health authorities have implemented many experiments in a short period and, in a mostly uninformed way, various combinations of interventions at different scales. These include a ban on large gatherings, closure of borders— individual and collective containment, monitoring of population movements, social tracing, social distancing, etc. However, as the pandemic is progressing, data are collected from various sources. On the one hand, authorities allow to make informed adjustments to the current and planned interventions and reveal them. On the other hand, an urgent need for tools and methodologies that enable fast analysis, understanding, comparison, and forecasting of the effectiveness of the responses against COVID-19 across different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computational modeling appears as invaluable leverage as it allows us to explore in silico a range of intervention strategies before the potential phase of field implementation.">

        <tr id="The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.">

We also show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting two parameters related to (a) population density and (b) aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics.

The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which demographic, geographic, and public health information a community together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our calculations suggest that massive testing is the most effective strategy to combat the likely increase in local cases due to mass ingress of a student population carrying a higher viral load than that currently present in the community.">

        <tr id="Background: Mounting evidence suggests that there is an undetected pool of COVID-19 asymptomatic but infectious cases. Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted. Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (MLSim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data. Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China's mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China's mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12. Conclusions: Machine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.">

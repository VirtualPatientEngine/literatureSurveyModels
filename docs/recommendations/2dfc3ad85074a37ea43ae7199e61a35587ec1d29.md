        <tr id="The 2020 world population data sheet estimates that 30 years from now, the population is intended to outstretch approximately up to 9.9 billion. The exponential rise in population has led to the agitation of land and the environment. Abrupt changes in climatic conditions and increasing global population emphasize the propagation of novel crops and acclimatization of the available plants and crops to obtain sufficient food in the extended future. In addition to ‘Omics’, bioinformatics plays an essential role in understanding the underlying mechanism of molecular functional systems in various plants. Bioinformatics contributes towards multi-disciplinary interactions and helps to reshape agricultural tradition and production, providing knowledge for enhanced plant quality, and it also provides a plan of action for protection against adverse environmental conditions. This review examines recent approaches in systems biology for predicting the functionality of genes and their networks (GRNs) along with its influential effect in current research involving various disciplines like genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, phenomics, interactomics, ionomics, epigenomics and metabolomics, which will be very useful to researchers in plant sciences.">

        <tr id="For more than a decade, the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade has been studied using mathematical modelling and quantitative experimentation [1]. The MAPK cascade relays the presence of extracellular stimuli such as growth hormones to the nucleus and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. MAPKs control major cell fate decisions such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, mainly by inducing alterations in gene expression. In this chapter, we discuss how systems biology analysis provides insights into the functioning of this cascade. We show how this pathway assists the cell in responding properly to extracellular cues by filtering out sub-threshold stimuli, while efficiently transmitting physiologically relevant inputs. Several different receptors signal through the MAPK pathway even though they elicit opposite biological responses, thus raising the question of how specificity is achieved in MAPK signalling. Experimental studies revealed that specific biological responses are encoded by quantitative aspects of the MAPK signal such as amplitude or duration. We discuss mechanisms that enable the pathway to generate quantitatively different signals, and also explain how different signals are interpreted by the downstream gene expression machinery.">

        <tr id="Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) is a component of the MAPK cascade pathway that plays an important role in plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stress, the functions of which have been well characterized in several plant species, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. In this study, we performed genome-wide and systemic bioinformatics analysis of MAPKKK family genes in Medicago truncatula. In total, there were 73 MAPKKK family members identified by search of homologs, and they were classified into three subfamilies, MEKK, ZIK, and RAF. Based on the genomic duplication function, 72 MtMAPKKK genes were located throughout all chromosomes, but they cluster in different chromosomes. Using microarray data and high-throughput sequencing-data, we assessed their expression profiles in growth and development processes; these results provided evidence for exploring their important functions in developmental regulation, especially in the nodulation process. Furthermore, we investigated their expression in abiotic stresses by RNA-seq, which confirmed their critical roles in signal transduction and regulation processes under stress. In summary, our genome-wide, systemic characterization and expressional analysis of MtMAPKKK genes will provide insights that will be useful for characterizing the molecular functions of these genes in M. truncatula.">

        <tr id="The advances in proteomics technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity and valuable resources to understand how living organisms execute necessary functions at systems levels. However, little work has been done up to date to utilize the highly accurate spatio-temporal dynamic proteome data generated by phosphoprotemics for mathematical modeling of complex cell signaling pathways. This work proposed a novel computational framework to develop mathematical models based on proteomic datasets. Using the MAP kinase pathway as the test system, we developed a mathematical model including the cytosolic and nuclear subsystems; and applied the genetic algorithm to infer unknown model parameters. Robustness property of the mathematical model was used as a criterion to select the appropriate rate constants from the estimated candidates. Quantitative information regarding the absolute protein concentrations was used to refine the mathematical model. We have demonstrated that the incorporation of more experimental data could significantly enhance both the simulation accuracy and robustness property of the proposed model. In addition, we used the MAP kinase pathway inhibited by phosphatases with different concentrations to predict the signal output influenced by different cellular conditions. Our predictions are in good agreement with the experimental observations when the MAP kinase pathway was inhibited by phosphatase PP2A and MKP3. The successful application of the proposed modeling framework to the MAP kinase pathway suggests that our method is very promising for developing accurate mathematical models and yielding insights into the regulatory mechanisms of complex cell signaling pathways.">

        <tr id="All cells receive and respond to signals from their environment, whether they live freely or are part of a tissue. Feedback loops are one among the interactions in signal-transduction cascades, in which the information from the downstream components is sent back to the upstream components of the system. Crosstalks between signal-transduction cascades are able to combine the information's received and processed to trigger the appropriate response. To understand how signaling networks make decisions, the dynamic interactions of proteins in the signal-transduction cascades are important rather than just creating static maps of pathways. Based on reaction kinetics, we have developed mathematical models to predict and analyze the impacts of the feedback loops in JNK cascades and the crosstalks between JNK and P38 kinase cascades. Feedback loops in JNK cascades and crosstalks between JNK and P38 kinase cascades plays the complementary roles in making the impacts on the activation of JNK and P38 kinases. JNK and P38 kinase cascades with feedbacks and crosstalks is a robust system.">

Systems biology aims to develop and use well-organized and efficient algorithms, data structure, visualization, and communication tools for the integration of these biological data with the goal of computational modeling and simulation. It studies crop plant systems by systematically perturbing them, checking the gene, protein, and informational pathway responses; integrating these data; and finally, formulating mathematical models that describe the structure of system and its response to individual perturbations. Consequently, systems biology approaches, such as integrative and predictive ones, hold immense potential in understanding of molecular mechanism of agriculturally important complex traits linked to agricultural productivity. This has led to identification of some key genes and proteins involved in networks of pathways involved in input use efficiency, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, photosynthesis efficiency, root, stem and leaf architecture, and nutrient mobilization. The developments in the above fields have made it possible to design smart crops with superior agronomic traits through genetic manipulation of key candidate genes.">

        <tr id="System dynamics is a popular approach in many fields of science and technology, but it has not been investigated for cell signaling pathways yet. It is a well formulated methodology used to analyze the components of a system considering the cause-effect relationships. The two main components of system dynamics modeling, Causal Loop and Stocks-Flow diagrams, make possible to model the dynamics of the system with the ability to analyze it both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this paper, after introducing the system dynamics modeling approach, and giving a simple example from its usage for Michaelis Menton reactions, a three-step process is proposed for signal transduction modeling. Then in a complete example, it is applied to a case study in cell signaling pathways, namely the RKIP Influence on the ERK signaling pathway and the results is compared with an integrative modeling approach based on Petri net and ODEs. Computational simulations show the success of the system dynamic in easier and effective modeling of the cell signaling pathways, in addition to its diverse options for understanding and testing the pathway quantitatively and quantitatively at the same time in relation to other methods. More intestinally, the suggested approach here helps one to identify all biochemical reaction paths and loops for complex cell signaling pathways. It will be a good step forward to define dominant systems for such complex cell signaling pathways.">

        <tr id="The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is considered to be a central block in many biological signaling networks. Despite the common core cascade structure, the activation of MAPK in different biological systems can exhibit different types of dynamic behaviors. Computer modeling may help to reveal the mechanisms underlying such variations. However, so far most computational models of the MAPK cascade have been system-specific, or to reflect a particular type among the wide spectrum of possible dynamics. To obtain a general and integrated view of the relationship between the dynamics of MAPK activation and the structures and parameters of the MAPK cascade, we constructed a generic model by comparing previous models covering different specific biological systems. We assumed that reliable qualitative results could be predicted through a qualitative model with pseudo parameters. We used randomly sampled parameters instead of a specific set of “best-fit” parameters to avoid biases towards any particular systems. A range of dynamics behaviors for MAPK activation, including ultrasensitivity, bistability, transient activation and oscillation, were successfully predicted by the generic model. The results indicated that the steady state dynamics (ultrasensitivity and bistability) was jointly determined by the three-tiered structure of the MAPK cascade and the competitive substrate binding in the dual-phosphorylation processes of the central components, while the temporal dynamics (transient activation and oscillation) was mainly affected by the upstream signaling pathway and feedbacks. Moreover, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) played more important roles than the other two components in determining the dynamics of MAPK activation. We hypothesize that this is an important and advantageous property for the regulation and for the functional diversity of MAPK pathways in real cells. Finally, to assist developing generic models for signaling motifs through model comparisons, we proposed a reaction-based database to make the model data more flexible and interoperable.">

These observations have been the basis for efforts to get the engineering and physical sciences involved in life sciences. The emergence of systems biology as a new area of research is evidence for these developments. Dynamic modelling and simulation of signal transduction pathways is an important theme in systems biology and is getting growing attention from researchers with an interest in the analysis of dynamic systems. This paper introduces systems biology in terms of the analysis and modelling of signal transduction pathways. Focusing on mathematical representations of cellular dynamics, a number of emerging challenges and perspectives are discussed.">

Currently, a common method of representing bio-pathways is through a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, calibrating and analyzing large ODE-based pathway models often requires a large number of numerical simulations. To address this issue, this book presents a probabilistic approximation approach. by which the analysis of ODE-based models can be considerably simplified. The applicability of these techniques has been by studying two existing pathways and a "live" pathway called the complement system in collaboration with biologists. Apart from improved performance, the crucial insights gained from the study of complement system could contribute to the development of immunomodulation therapies. This book should be useful to researches in Computational Systems Biology field, or anyone else who may be considering utilizing ODEs for their modeling efforts.">

        <tr id="The Signal transduction pathway uses docking interaction with kinases which may also be regulated by phosphorylation. Regulation of these docking interactions by phosphorylation allows an additional level of control over the diverse biological processes including Crosstalk induction of defense. Amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation motif have been extensively studied. However, the present study, attempts have been made to identify the presence of important determinants/motifs for substrate specificity of Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), CaM kinase II, Protein kinase C, Receptor tyrosine kinase in the 54 identified MAPK 3 and MAPK 6 substrates of Arabidopsis thaliana. All identified substrates do not possess the known (p) S/ (p) T-P phosphorylation sites. Out of 54 substrates, 47 have S/T-P site and 7 are lacking such sites for interaction. Likewise 8 shows XXRRX(p)S pattern, 28 shows HYDXRXX(p)SXX pattern , 35 shows HYDXXRXX(p)S pattern, 12 shows R/K(1-3)X(p) S/T(HYD)R/K(1-3) pattern and 17 shows Na(1-3)-X-(p)Y-XX-HYD pattern. In order to ascertain the role of surrounding hydrophobic amino acids in the interaction, the other conserved pattern/Motif were also identified in the MAPK substrates which include XXRRX(p)S, HYDXRXX(p)SXX, HYDXXRXX(p)S, R/K(1-3)X(p)S/T(HYD)R/K(1-3), Na(1-3)-X- (p)Y-XX-HYD (Na-Hydrophilic; HYD- Hydrophobic; X- Any amino acid) pattern. These conserved patterns show activation sites for other kinases viz. MAPK Activated Protein kinase-1, MAPK Activated Protein kinase -2, CaM Kinase II, Protein kinase C, Tyrosine protein kinase respectively. Identification of interacting partners based on the surrounding amino acids of phosphorylation sites could be useful in the understanding of such complex hierarchical networks involved in controlling the defense signaling pathways.">

Modularized study of such networks will be more appropriate for deciphering the underlying mechanisms that control physiological behavior of cell(s). Here we have proposed an algorithm for modularizing signal transduction network which is applied to MAPK pathway of D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. The idea "a member whose activity is controlled by maximum number of other members in the network under consideration, tends to be the center of a module" is used to divide a network into different modules. These modules are created by taking a certain level of complexity c into account, i.e., in an expanding module, a member having more than c relations that lie outside the module, are ignored. Recursive modularization can create modules at different stages of various complexities that finally lead to convergence of the entire network into a single module">

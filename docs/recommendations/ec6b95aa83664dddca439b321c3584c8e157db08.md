        <tr id="Representation of intracellular signaling networks as directed graphs allows for the identification of regulatory motifs. Regulatory motifs are groups of nodes with the same connectivity structure, capable of processing information. The bifan motif, made of two source nodes directly crossregulating two target nodes, is an overrepresented motif in a mammalian cell signaling network and in transcriptional networks. One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38, and JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and Elk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to analyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it interacts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our results indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation and act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers. Bifans that have OR gate configurations show rapid responses whereas AND gate bifans can introduce delays and allow prolongation of signal outputs. Bifans that have AND gates can filter noisy signal inputs. The p38/JNK-ATF2/Elk-1bifan synchronizes the output of activated transcription factors. Synchronization is a robust property of bifans and is exhibited even when the bifan is adjacent to a positive feedback loop. The presence of the bifan promotes the transcription and translation of the dual specificity protein phosphatase MKP-1 that inhibits p38 and JNK thus enabling a negative feedback loop. These results indicate that bifan motifs in cell signaling networks can contribute to signal processing capability both intrinsically and by enabling the functions of other regulatory motifs.">

        <tr id="With the advent of high-throughput biology, we now routinely scan cells and organisms at practically all levels, from genome to protein, metabolism, signaling and other cellular functions. This methodology allowed biological studies to move from a reductionist approach, such as isolation of specific pathways and mechanisms, to a more integrative approach, where biological systems are seen as a network of interconnected components that provide specific outputs and functions in response to stimuli. Recent literature on biological networks demonstrates two important concepts that we will consider in this review: (i) cellular pathways are highly interconnected and should not be studied separately, but as a network; (ii) simple, recurrent feedback motifs within the network can produce very specific functions that favor their modular use. The first theme differs from the traditional approach in biology because it provides a framework (i.e., the network view) in which large datasets are analyzed with an unbiased view. The second theme (feedback motifs) shows the importance of locally analyzing the dynamic properties of biological networks in order to better understand their functionality. We will review these themes with examples from cell signaling networks, gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways. The deregulation of cellular networks (metabolism, signaling etc.) is involved in cancer, but the size of the networks and resulting non-linear behavior do not allow for intuitive reasoning. In that context, we argue that the qualitative classification of the 'building blocs' of biological networks (i.e. the motifs) in terms of dynamics and functionality will be critical to improve our understanding of cancer biology and rationalize the wealth of information from high-throughput experiments. From the examples highlighted in this review, it is clear that dynamic feedback motifs can be used to provide a unified view of various cellular processes involved in cancer and this will be critical for future research on personalized and predictive cancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Signaling pathways come together to form networks that connect receptors to many different cellular machines. Such networks not only receive and transmit signals but also process information. The complexity of these networks requires the use of computational models to understand how information is processed and how input-output relationships are determined. Two major computational approaches used to study signaling networks are graph theory and dynamical modeling. Both approaches are useful; network analysis (application of graph theory) helps us understand how the signaling network is organized and what its information-processing capabilities are, whereas dynamical modeling helps us determine how the system changes in time and space upon receiving stimuli. Computational models have helped us identify a number of emergent properties that signaling networks possess. Such properties include ultrasensitivity, bistability, robustness, and noise-filtering capabilities. These properties endow cell-signaling networks with the ability to ignore small or transient signals and/or amplify signals to drive cellular machines that spawn numerous physiological functions associated with different cell states.">

        <tr id="Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades process a myriad of stimuli received by cell‐surface receptors and generate precise spatiotemporal guidance for multiple target proteins, dictating receptor‐specific cellular outcomes. Computational modeling reveals that the intrinsic topology of MAPK cascades enables them to amplify signal sensitivity and amplitude, reduce noise, and display intricate dynamic properties, which include toggle switches, excitation pulses, and oscillations. Specificity of signaling responses can be brought about by signal‐induced feedback and feedforward wiring imposed on the MAPK cascade backbone. Intracellular gradients of protein activities arise from the spatial separation of opposing reactions in kinase‐phosphatase cycles. The membrane confinement of the initiating kinase in MAPK cascades and cytosolic localization of phosphatases can result in precipitous gradients of phosphorylated signal‐transducers if they spread solely by diffusion. Endocytotic trafficking of active kinases driven by molecular motors and traveling waves of protein phosphorylation can propagate phosphorylation signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, especially in large cells, such as Xenopus eggs.

        <tr id="Bayesian inference–based modeling identifies the most likely paths through a signaling network. Picking the Right Path Signaling networks have become increasingly complex as large-scale analysis and experiments in multiple systems add new potential connections and players. Xu et al. present a mathematical approach to rank the possible paths through a signaling pathway and develop hypotheses that can be rationally tested. They call their approach BIBm for Bayesian inference–based modeling and apply BIBm to explore the signaling pathways by which epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). Using a limited set of biochemical experiments, the authors tested four models and found that the one that relied on two Raf family members ranked the highest. This model was then experimentally validated in two cell lines to show that both Raf-1 and B-Raf contribute to ERK activation in response to EGF. The specification of biological decisions by signaling pathways is encoded by the interplay between activation dynamics and network topologies. Although we can describe complex networks, we cannot easily determine which topology the cell actually uses to transduce a specific signal. Experimental testing of all plausible topologies is infeasible because of the combinatorially large number of experiments required to explore the complete hypothesis space. Here, we demonstrate that Bayesian inference–based modeling provides an approach to explore and constrain this hypothesis space, permitting the rational ranking of pathway models. Our approach can use measurements of a limited number of biochemical species when combined with multiple perturbations. As proof of concept, we examined the activation of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by epidermal growth factor. The predicted and experimentally validated model shows that both Raf-1 and, unexpectedly, B-Raf are needed to fully activate ERK in two different cell lines. Thus, our formal methodology rationally infers evidentially supported pathway topologies even when a limited number of biochemical and kinetic measurements are available.">

        <tr id="CIRIT, MURAT. Predictive Computational Models of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signaling Networks Driven by Quantitative Measurements of System Dynamics. (Under the direction of Jason M. Haugh.) Signal transduction networks in mammalian cells, comprised of a limited set of interacting biochemical pathways, are accessed by various growth factor and cytokine receptors to elicit distinct cell responses. This raises the question as to how specificity of the stimulus-response relationship is encoded at the molecular level. In mammalian cells, the Ras/ERK pathway controls cell proliferation and other responses stimulated by growth factors, and several crosstalk and feedback mechanisms affecting its activation have been identified. Here we present a systematic, comparative analysis of the signaling networks accessed by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors in mouse fibroblasts, in which the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is activated by Rasand phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathways and is subjected to three layers of ERK-dependent feedback: desensitization of Ras activation, negative regulation of MEK kinase (e.g. Raf) activities, and upregulation of dual-specificity ERK phosphatases. Through the formulation and analysis of data-driven mathematical models, we show that while the FGF stimulation of PI3K signaling is relatively weak, this deficiency is compensated for by a more potent, Ras-dependent activation of ERK. We take a systematic approach to parse the magnitudes of multiple regulatory mechanisms that attenuate ERK activation through canonical (Ras-dependent) and non-canonical (PI3Kdependent) pathways. Our results establish the second of these as the dominant mode of ERK self-regulation in mouse fibroblasts. We further demonstrate that models of signaling networks, trained on a sufficient diversity of quantitative data, can be reasonably comprehensive, accurate, and predictive in the dynamical sense.

Using a mathematical model for three-node feed-forward loops, we identify that the organization of motifs in specific manner within the network serves as an important regulator of signal processing. Further, incorporating a systemic stochastic perturbation to the model we could propose a possible design principle, for higher-order organization of motifs into larger networks in order to achieve specific biological output. The design principle was then verified in a large, complex human cancer signaling network. Further analysis permitted us to classify signaling nodes of the network into robust and vulnerable nodes as a result of higher order motif organization. We show that distribution of these nodes within the network at strategic locations then provides for the range of features displayed by the signaling network.">

In biology, network motifs that reappear within a network more often than expected in random networks include negative autoregulation, positive autoregulation, single-input modules, feedforward loops, dense overlapping regulons and feedback loops. These network motifs have their different dynamical functions. In this study, our main objective is to examine the enrichment of network motifs in different biological networks of human disease specific pathways. We characterize biological network motifs as biologically significant sub-graphs. We used computational and statistical criteria for efficient detection of biological network motifs, and introduced several estimation measures. Pathways of cardiovascular, cancer, infectious, repair, endocrine and metabolic diseases, were used for identifying and interlinking the relation between nodes. 3–8 sub-graph size network motifs were generated. Network Motif Database was then developed using PHP and MySQL. Results showed that there is an abundance of autoregulation, feedforward loops, single-input modules, dense overlapping regulons and other putative regulatory motifs in all the diseases included in this study. It is believed that the database will assist molecular and system biologists, biotechnologists, and other scientific community to encounter biologically meaningful information.

Network modeling of disease pathways considers disease-related bio-molecules (e.g. DNA, RNA, transcription factors, enzymes, proteins, and metabolites) and their interaction (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification, alternative splicing, and protein modification) to study disease progression and predict therapeutic responses. These bio-molecules and their interactions are the basic elements in the study of the misregulation in the disease-related gene expression that lead to abnormal cellular responses. Gene regulatory networks, cell signaling networks, and metabolic networks are the three major types of intracellular networks for the study of the cellular responses elicited from extracellular signals. The disease-related cellular responses can be prevented or regulated by designing control strategies to manipulate these extracellular or other intracellular signals. The paper reviews the regulatory mechanisms, the dynamic models, and the control strategies for each intracellular network.

Combining graph theoretic methods with available dynamics information, we successfully retrieved multiple feedback modules of three important signaling networks. These feedbacks are structurally arranged in a hierarchical way and dynamically produce layered temporal profiles of output signals. We found that global and local feedbacks act in very different ways and on distinct features of the information flow conveyed by signal transduction but work highly coordinately to implement specific biological functions. The redundancy embodied with multiple signal-relaying channels and feedback controls bestow great robustness and the reaction hubs seated at junctions of different paths announce their paramount importance through exquisite parameter management. The current investigation reveals intriguing general features of the organization of cell signaling networks and their relevance to biological function, which may find interesting applications in analysis, design and control of bio-networks.">

The advancements in “omics” (proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) technologies have yielded large inventories of genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. The challenge is to find out how these entities work together to regulate the processes by which cells respond to external and internal signals. Mathematical and computational modeling of signaling networks has a key role in this task, and network analysis provides insights into biological systems and has applications for medicine. Here, we review experimental and theoretical progress and future challenges toward this goal. We focus on how networks are reconstructed from data, how these networks are structured to control the flow of biological information, and how the design features of the networks specify biological decisions. How do cells perceive their environment and produce appropriate responses? The sensing and coordination of proper responses is coordinated by intricate biochemical networks that integrate signals and compute biological responses with high fidelity and reproducibility. Modern “omics” (proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) techniques have identified many of the components of these networks, but researchers are now faced with the challenge of unraveling how the components are connected and how they compute. To elucidate these network properties, various mathematical and computational modeling techniques are used because their complexity defeats human intuition. The results indicate that signaling networks show a wide diversity of behaviors encoded in their design, but that they are also very flexible, with cells adapting their networks in response to different contexts by changing connectivities. The remaining challenges include integration of data generated with methods for the analysis of different types of networks (gene regulation, protein modification, and metabolic networks), and generation of coherent network interpretations that are widely accessible and can generate new hypotheses that are experimentally testable and that will push the knowledge frontier in biology and biomedicine.">

This approach is called extreme signaling pathway analysis and involves the description of network properties with systemically independent basis vectors called extreme pathways. From the extreme signaling pathways, emergent systems properties of the JAK-STAT signaling network have been characterized, including 1), a mathematical definition of network crosstalk; 2), an analysis of redundancy in signaling inputs and outputs; 3), a study of reaction participation in the network; and 4), a delineation of 85 correlated reaction sets, or systemic signaling modules. This study is the first such analysis of an actual biological signaling system. Extreme signaling pathway analysis is a topologically based approach and assumes a balanced use of the signaling network. As large-scale reconstructions of signaling networks emerge, such scalable analyses will lead to a description of the fundamental systems properties of signal transduction networks.">

In the past, signal transduction has largely been regarded as a linear process. However, more recent data from large‐scale and high‐throughput experiments indicate that there is extensive cross‐talk between individual signaling cascades leading to the notion of a signaling network. The behavior of such complex networks cannot be predicted by simple intuitive approaches but requires sophisticated models and computational simulations. The purpose of such models is to generate experimentally testable hypotheses and to find explanations for unexpected experimental results. Here, we discuss the need for, and the future impact of, mathematical models for exploring signal transduction in different biological contexts such as for example development.

        <tr id="A hybrid modeling framework integrating a highly specific mechanistic model with highly abstract empirical model is presented. With the growing interest in the scientific and medical community for identification of therapeutic targets in treatment of disease, it is necessary to develop predictive models that can describe cellular behavior in response to environmental cues. Intracellular signaling pathways form complex networks that regulate cellular response in both health and disease. Mechanistic (or white-box) models of biochemical networks are often unable to explain comprehensive cellular response due to lack of knowledge and/or intractable complexity (especially in events distal from the cell membrane). Empirical (or black-box) models may provide a less than accurate representation of cellular response due to data deficiency and/or loss of mechanistic detail. In the proposed framework, we use a mechanistic model to capture early signaling events and apply the resulting generated internal signals (along with external inputs) to a downstream empirical sub-model. The key construct in the approach is the treatment of a cell’s biochemical network as an encoder that creates a functional internal representation of external environmental cues. The signals derived from this representation are then used to inform downstream behaviors. Using this idea, we are able to create a comprehensive framework that describes important mechanisms with sufficient detail, while representing complex or unknown mechanisms in a more abstract form. The model is verified using published biological data describing T-Cells in immune response.Copyright © 2013 by ASME">

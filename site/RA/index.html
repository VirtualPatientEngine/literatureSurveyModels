        <tr id="BACKGROUND
There are limited data on the real-world utilization of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in Indian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study of a multicentric observational cohort of RA patients across rheumatology clinics at six centers across India. Patients who met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria for RA were included. The demographics, disease-related parameters, and current therapy in terms of DMARDs were analyzed using a structured paper or electronic case record form.


RESULTS
This study included 4,061 patients with RA across six centers in India. A majority were female (female-to-male ratio, 6:1), and their mean [standard deviation (SD)] age at the time of enrollment was 51 (12.2) years. Rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP were positive in 79 and 77%, respectively. Data on DMARDs were available for 3,550 RA patients. Conventional synthetic DMARDs alone were being used in 3,289 (93%), targeted synthetic DMARDs in 203 (6%), and biological DMARDs in 67 (2%). A total of at least 18 separate types or combinations of DMARDs were being prescribed, with the most common being a combination of methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (22%), methotrexate monotherapy (17%), and a combination of methotrexate and leflunomide (16%). Overall, the most common DMARD prescribed (as monotherapy or in combination) was methotrexate (86%), followed by hydroxychloroquine (52%) and leflunomide (37%).


CONCLUSION
Cs-DMARDs remain the mainstay in the treatment of Indian patients with RA in this study, with the majority being treated with methotrexate alone or in combination with other DMARDs.">

        <tr id="Purpose Therapies for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have shown significant improvement since the introduction of biological agents (BIO) in 2003 and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in 2013 in Japan. The rate of orthopedic surgery, including total hip arthroplasties (THA), may reflect trends in disease severity, management, and health outcomes. Materials and Methods An analysis of data on THAs performed at our institutes for treatment of RA with BIO or non-BIO therapy from 2004 to 2021 was conducted. Results A total of 40,328 orthopedic surgeries, including 5,938 primary THAs and 204 RA-THAs, were performed between 2004 and 2021. An increase in the annual rate of THA performed for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery was observed. The rates of THA decreased annually for patients with RA when compared to the total number of orthopedic surgeries and primary THAs performed. Conclusion The number of THAs performed for patients with RA may show an annual decrease resulting from early and aggressive drug therapy for management of RA in the era of BIO and JAKi. However, patients with RA undergoing THA have several unmet needs, including secondary osteoarthritis, dislocation, periprosthetic joint infection, and periprosthetic fracture with osteoporosis.">

        <tr id="Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease. Treatment aims to improve functional capacity and quality of life. Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and oral inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs) used in treatment are high cost. The objective of this study was to analyze the profile of use and expenses of these medicines used in Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS). Methods This is a retrospective cohort of users who received at least one biological DMARDs or oral inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs) registered in the Open Room on Health Intelligence—Sabeis/Datasus. The valuation of the 11 drugs standardized by the Clinical Protocols and Therapeutic Guidelines (PCDT) was carried out based on public purchases registered in the Price Bank in Health and an active search with the Ministry of Health, between 2017 and 2021. Expenses were calculated based on the number of High Complexity Procedure Authorizations (APACs) registered in the SIA/SUS database. Results Evaluation of 195,163 patient dispensing records was undertaken. Spending on medicines was BRL408,146,527 (USD79,012,759) in 2017, BRL237,615,290 (USD46,002,748) in 2018, BRL213,790,222 (USD41,350,815) in 2019, BRL195,626,575 (USD37,837,644) in 2020, and BRL140,096,142 (USD27,109,717) in 2021. It was found that in 2017, adalimumab (33%), etanercept (28%), and golimumab (14%) were the most used biological DMARDs. It is worth noting that in 2017, adalimumab and etanercept represented more than 50 percent of the costs of treating RA in the SUS. In 2021, it was found that 61 percent of total expenses were distributed between the drugs etanercept (23%), golimumab (18%), certolizumab (14%), adalimumab (11%), and tofacitinib (11%). Conclusions In the period from 2017 to 2021, changes can be observed in the profile of use and expenditure of biological DMARDs and oral inhibitor JAKs, resulting from the incorporation of new drugs and the entry of biosimilars in the Brazilian market. However, adalimumab, one of the first biological DMARDs incorporated, is the most consumed and least expensive medicine.">

 Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic autoimmune skin and joint inflammatory disease affecting ∼0.34% of people in Malaysia. PsO patients are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Understanding how biologics and non-biologics impact CMDs and PsA development in PsO patients is crucial. This study aims to explore the disease burden, treatment outcomes, and new onset of CMDs and PsA with biologic and non-biologic systemic treatments in adult Malaysian PsO patients. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study based on the Malaysian Psoriasis Registry (MPR) data (January 2013–December 2022) of adult PsO patients who had received non-biologic systemic treatment (acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine or combinations) or biologics [interleukin inhibitors (IL17i, IL12/23i and IL23i), tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)] for at least 12 months. Descriptive analyses were performed on baseline characteristics, and treatment outcomes by treatment regimens at 12 and 24 months. The incidence rates of CMDs [ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)] and PsA were compared by treatment regimens over 2 years. This analysis included 1721 PsO patients. At baseline, patients on biologics were younger (41 vs. >46 years), had earlier disease onset (26 vs. >29 years), more severe disease [psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 20 vs. <15], and a higher rate of PsO family history (35 vs. <26%) than non-biologic patients. Biologic-treated patients experienced more pain, itch, and worse quality of life (QoL) than the non-biologics patients at baseline. More patients in the biologic group (especially IL17i) had less body surface area affected (<5% body surface area) at 12 and 24 months and better QoL [lower dermatology life quality index (DLQI)] at 12 months. At 24 months, QoL (DLQI) was similar for biologics and non-biologics, but the IL17i biologic group had the highest reduction in DLQI scores. At both time points, biologically treated patients had lower incidences of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia, and no newly reported IHD, stroke, depression, or NAFLD (at 12 months). Additionally, a lower PsA incidence was reported in biologic-treated patients at 12 months, with the IL17i group remaining PsA-free. At 24 months, the non-biologic cohort reported lower PsA incidence while the IL17i and TNFi biologic groups had no new PsA. PsO patients on biologics had better improvement in disease severity and lower risk of developing CMDs compared with non-biologics. Only IL17i-treated patients reported no new incidences of PsA over 2 years. Initiating biologic therapy (especially IL17i) early may enhance treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of new onset of CMDs and PsA in PsO patients.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset, primarily characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. MCP-1 is a cytokine with chemotactic effects on monocytes, which can regulate their migration and infiltration and participate in disease progression. Increasing evidence suggests that MCP-1 plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and has the potential to act as an early diagnostic marker and intervention target. This paper reviews the regulatory role of MCP-1 in neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and Tau pathology, and explores the potential of MCP-1 as a biomarker and intervention target for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Mutations in genes and precursors of β amyloid (Aβ) are found in the familial form of the disease. This led to the evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies against Aβ in subjects with AD, two of which were approved for use by the FDA. They caused only a small improvement in cognitive function, probably because they were given to those with much more prevalent sporadic forms of dementia. They also have potentially serious adverse effects. Oxidative stress and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines are present in all subjects with AD and are well correlated with the degree of memory impairment. Drugs that affect these processes include TNFα blocking antibodies and MAPK p38 inhibitors that reduce cognitive impairment when given for other inflammatory conditions. However, their adverse effects and inability to penetrate the brain preclude their use for dementia. Rosiglitazone is used to treat diabetes, a risk factor for AD, but failed in a clinical trial because it was given to subjects that already had dementia. Ladostigil reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated microglia without blocking their effects. Chronic oral administration to aging rats prevented the decline in memory and suppressed overexpression of genes adversely affecting synaptic function in relevant brain regions. In a phase 2 trial, ladostigil reduced the decline in short-term memory and in whole brain and hippocampal volumes in human subjects with mild cognitive impairment and had no more adverse effects than placebo.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background We aim to repurpose the widely used adjuvant and immunomodulator AlhydrogelTM at a specific dose and schedule (AD04) as a disease‐modifying treatment for mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD04 is a potent adjuvant commonly used in vaccines and allergy immunotherapies to augment the magnitude and durability of the immune response. Our preliminary data come from a clinical Phase 2 study in which AD04 served as a control arm. In this study, AD04 showed promising results in delaying hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline, as well as improving the quality of life in patients with mild AD. A global statistical test (GST) was used to compare the treatment effect of AD04 to other drugs/drug candidates. GST used is a combination of ADAS‐cog, ADCS‐ADL and the CDR‐sb. As such, it combines three important perspectives of three different aspects of AD progression. The effect size seen with AD04 is comparable or better than that of most other available treatments. However, the precise mode of action of subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of AD04 on the brain has not been deciphered. Method Aged (24 mo) C57BL/6 mice were injected s.c. with AD04 or with PBS, three times, and 3‐5 days after the last injection they were tested for fear conditioning. One day later, the mice were sacrificed, and hippocampi and peripheral organs were subjected to proteomics. Young (10wks) mice were used as controls. Result In the fear conditioning test, AD04‐treated old mice, exhibited an improved freezing behavior compared with the PBS‐injected mice. Proteomics analysis of the hippocampi revealed that peripheral AD04 administration modulated the production of proteins involved in lipid metabolism regulation and affected microglial phenotype into a phagocytic type. Conclusion Based on these preclinical results we conclude that AD04 administration induces microglia to phagocytose brain debris, such as apoptotic neurons, synapses and degraded myelin in the aged brain, and in the AD brain also Abeta, extracellular tau tangles and oxidized lipids. By changing the microglial phenotype, AD04, indirectly reduces the neuroinflammation induced by Abeta, tau and neuronal debris, leading to an anti‐inflammatory milieu in the brain which protects and rescues the hippocampus from neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) onset, pathophysiology, and progression. The aim of our meta-analysis was to review the available literature to assess the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the two most common neurological diseases: Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Two medical databases were searched: Web of Science and PubMed in the period from 2009-2023, where a total of 37 publications that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further evaluation. Both patients with AD and with PD showed statistically significantly higher levels of interleukin IL-6 compared to the control group: p-value of 0.0034 for AD (SMD, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.39-1.96) and p-value of 0.0487 for PD (SMD 0.29 95% Cl 0.00-0.59). In AD patients, statistical significance (for random effect) was also observed for IL-1β, where higher values of this cytokine were recorded in patients compared to controls (p-value <0.001). In turn, in patients with PD, apart from IL-6, statistical significance was also observed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p= 0.0431, SMD 0.52 95%Cl 0.02-1.02). Significant heterogeneity was also recorded (Q =85.48; P < 0.01; I2 = 87%). In both study groups, significant differences in common effect were observed for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which could suggest a protective effect of this cytokine in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The obtained results reinforce the existing clinical evidence that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are accompanied by an inflammatory response, with considerably higher blood levels observed for pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The success of therapeutic options for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the growing emphasis for such treatment to commence in the pre-clinical phase makes it necessary to have robust empirical models of clinical disease progression to understand findings from clinical trials, allow clinicians to evaluate effects of new drugs, and to select individuals for future trials. Such models have been developed from relatively small samples, with incomplete data/substantial loss to follow-up. The ADOPIC consortium provides the largest complete AD natural history sample to date. We applied our sigmoid models of disease progression to cognitive data from ADOPIC, and developed an algorithm to predict cognitive change.


METHOD
We developed an online application (Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Progression Tool, [PADPT]) to estimate decline in cognition over the course of AD within 2,861 ADOPIC participants (1,434 Cognitively unimpaired [CU], 342 MCI [Mild Cognitive Impairment], 211 AD, and 847 progressed from CU→MCI or MCI→AD), with ≥1 PET Amyloid (Aβ) scan and ≥36 months of cognitive assessment with the pre-clinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite (PACC). Individual participant slopes were defined according to age and gender using linear mixed effects models. Aβ+ (≥50CL) participant rates of decline vs their mean PACC score were investigated using quantile polynomial regression. Within PADPT, single visit information on age, clinical classification and APOE ε4 allele status is entered to compute the estimated annual rate of decline. Candidate results are mapped to the sigmoid curve to determine their predicted rate of cognitive decline over the chosen time period.


RESULT
Quantile regression bands (QRB's) aligned with participant cognitive decline. Individuals with stable cognition clustered to the top right of the plot (Figure 1). Mean slopes for APOE ε4 allele status separated QRB's for CU and AD, but not for MCI groups. All participants allocated to cognitive decline groups (past the first sigmoid inflection point) demonstrated decline in PACC score that remained in the QRB's, regardless of initial clinical classification.


CONCLUSION
Used in conjunction with baseline profile information, the PADPT application can assist with clinical decision making both pre and post-treatment and also identify suitable clinical trial candidates who, untreated, will show subtle decline in cognition.">

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Tramiprosate is an amyloid protein (Aß) antagonist. It binds to soluble Aß and prevents conformational transitions that progress to plaque deposition. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramiprosate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.


METHOD
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane library on 10/6/2020 and then updated the search on 2/5/2022 for clinical trials that compare between tramiprosate and placebo in Alzheimer's disease. We pooled data as mean difference (MD) or relative risk (RR) values using Review Manager 5.3 for windows.


RESULT
Five studies were included in the qualitative analysis and only three of them were eligible for quantitative analysis. There was no significant difference between tramiprosate and placebo in terms of baseline-endpoint change in Alzheimer's disease assessment scale - Cognitive subscale Score; neither in DIB 100 mg dose (MD = -.08, 95%CI [-1.82, 1.65], P = 0.09) nor in DIB 150 mg (MD = -0.22, 95%CI [-1.96, 1.51], P = 0.80). Also, there was no significant difference between tramiprosate and placebo in terms of baseline-endpoint change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of boxes; neither in DIB 100 mg dose (MD = 0.08, 95%CI [-0.41, 0.57], P = 0.75) nor in DIB 150 mg (MD = 0.20, 95%CI [-0.29, 0.69], P = 0.42). Regarding safety, there was no significant difference between tramiprosate in terms of DIB 100 mg dose and placebo in side effects except in the incidence of nausea that was significantly higher in the placebo than in tramiprosate groups (RR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.02,1.94], p = 0.04). In terms of DIB 150 mg dose, there was no significant difference between tramiprosate and placebo in the incidence of side effects except in nausea (RR = 1.80, 95% CI [1.32, 2.44], p = 0.0002), vomiting (RR = 1.75, 95% CI [1.18, 2.61], p = 0.006), and decreased weight (RR = 2.28, 95% CI [1.49, 3.49], p = 0.0002) that were significantly higher in placebo than tramiprosate groups.


CONCLUSION
tramiprosate is not effective in the treatment of AD, although it may have fewer side effects. We recommend other studies to investigate mechanisms other than targeting Aß in the treatment of AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by a decrease in cognitive and behavioral functions of patients. Between the multiple potential disease‐modifying therapeutics for AD, we have monoclonal antibodies as aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. Recent results from the TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ trial, highlighted donanemab as a promising monoantibodies treatment of early symptomatic AD. Donanemab targets the N‐terminal region of pyroglutamate Aβ plaques. It is designed to bind selectively to these plaques. This targeting mechanism offers a focused approach in the treatment and potential amelioration of the disease’s symptoms. Method systematic search in the meta search engines of Pubmed and TRIP database, described in the diagram Result Donanemab follows a two‐compartment model with first order elimination and in several studies found that reduction of amyloid plaque is associated with maintenance of donanemab threshold serum concentrations above 4.43 µg/ml. The difference in iADRS score changed ‐6.86 in donanemab group and ‐10.06 in placebo group. Also amyloid plaques clearance measured by florbetapir PET was 85.06 centiloids more than in the placebo group, −84.13 centiloids for donanemab vs. 0.93 centiloids for placebo. In early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, donanemab as treatmenet, resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks. Among the side effects that were seen across studies were amyloid‐related edema or stroke (mostly asymptomatic) occurring with donanemab and no exposure threshold was identified as being associated with an increased risk of ARIA‐E. The apparent effect of donanemab on ARIA‐E was generated primarily in participants who were carriers of the APOE ε4 gene. Conclusion Preliminary data indicates its potential in effectively impeding the progression of the disease, as observed in the extracted articles. In order to comprehensively grasp the implications of the observed rise in CSF Aβ42 and its correlation with cognitive and clinical effects. While there is limited research available, the current evidence suggests that donanemab is indeed efficacious in halting the advancement of the disease. Donanemab has emerged as a promising option, yet its status is not definitive due to the associated risk of developing ARIA‐E during its administration.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Solanezumab, a promising treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, has captured the attention of the medical community. This monoclonal antibody is designed to target and clear beta‐amyloid plaques, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s, from the brain. While initial clinical trials showed mixed results, ongoing research is exploring its potential to slow cognitive decline and improve the lives of those affected by this devastating neurodegenerative condition. Method A systematic review and meta analysis was conducted and 6 studies out of 1202 were included. The total number of the patients were 4956 And all the studies were Randomised clinical trials. 5 RCTs included, outcome of (ADAS‐Cog14, ADAS‐Cog11, MMSE, CDR‐SB Score), intervention number in each Trial (n1 = 578, n2 = 102, n3 = 50, n4 = 1057, n5 = 659), Analysis was done by Review manager program version 5.0 and I2 of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Result Improvements in cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS‐cog14) were observed by 5 studies (Farlow, Honig, Joseph, Salloway, Siemers). The overall pooled results showed that Solanezumab is associated with a significant reduction in ADAS‐ Cog 14 scores as compared to placebo. (MD ‐1.18,95% CI(‐1.96,‐0.40); p = 0.003, I2 = 0%). ADAS‐Cog11: Improvements in cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS‐cog11) were observed by 2 studies(Farlow, Honig,).

(MD ‐1.68,95% CI(‐2.80,‐0.55); p = 0.003, I2 = 0%) CDR‐SB :Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR‐SB) is reported by 5 studies (Honig, Joseph, Salloway, Siemers, Sperling). The overall pooled results showed that Solanezumab led to substantial improvement in CDR‐SB as compared to placebo. (MD ‐0.22,95% CI(‐0.42,‐0.01); p = 0.04, I2 = 0%). Conclusion Solanezumab’s potential as an Alzheimer’s disease treatment has spurred considerable scientific interest and debate. This monoclonal antibody specifically targets beta‐amyloid plaques, a prominent feature in Alzheimer’s brains. While initial clinical trials showed disappointing results in terms of halting cognitive decline, some argue that the drug may still have promise when administered at earlier stages of the disease or in combination with other therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils. In two clinical study evaluations of lecanemab, Clarity AD (NCT03887455) and lecanemab phase 2 study (Study 201, NCT01767311), the drug showed statistically significant reduction in disease progression during 18 months of treatment relative to placebo. Anti‐amyloid immunotherapy can result in higher rates of “pseudo‐atrophy” (ie, whole brain volume loss or ventricular enlargement) relative to disease progression observed in placebo‐treated subjects. Herein, we evaluated volumetric MRI changes associated with lecanemab treatment to assess the neurological impact. Method Volumetric MRI changes over the duration of the Clarity AD study was compared between placebo and lecanemab‐treated participants (n = 1311). In addition, the association between pseudo‐atrophy and longitudinal changes in tau and amyloid PET were evaluated regionally in a subset of participants in the Clarity AD PET sub‐study (n = 342). The association between volume changes and fluid biomarkers was also investigated. Result Volumetric MRI results were inconsistent, with slowing of hippocampal atrophy but greater whole brain volume loss on lecanemab relative to placebo. Volume loss was not associated with worsening in any neurodegenerative biomarkers (plasma NfL, CSF NfL, and t‐tau) or clinical outcomes (CDR‐SB, ADAS‐Cog14, ADCS MCI‐ADL). With disease progression (placebo group), regional atrophy was associated with regional tau accumulation, but was not associated with regional amyloid accumulation. With lecanemab treatment, regional pseudo‐atrophy was associated with amyloid clearance and was not associated with regional tau levels or neuronal loss. Conclusion Greater volume loss may be related to reduced amyloid plaques and associated dystrophic neurites as well as inflammation/gliosis. Volume changes are not accompanied with worsening in any neurodegeneration biomarkers and likely do not represent neuronal loss.">

        <tr id="Abstract Numerous drugs (including disease‐modifying therapies, cognitive enhancers and neuropsychiatric treatments) are being developed for Alzheimer’s and related dementias (ADRD). Emerging neuroimaging modalities, and genetic and other biomarkers potentially enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. These advances need to be assessed in real‐world studies (RWS). Currently, there are several national and two emerging international ADRD registries that differ in their data requirements. For instance, most existing registries do not routinely capture safety data. Outcome harmonisation would facilitate collaboration between international and national registries and, in turn, support interoperability, and enhance the statistical power and external validity of RWS. In response, the International Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease and other Dementias (InRAD) convened a Steering Committee of leaders and investigators from registries in Europe, Asia and Australia to define a harmonised minimum dataset (MDS) and extended dataset (EDS) that enables collaboration. A wider stakeholder group, including patient representatives, regulators, payors and industry, will validate the agreed MDS and EDS (Figure 1). The harmonised MDS and EDS will form the basis of data captured in InRAD, which can also form the foundation of collaboration in future RWS within and across registries (Figures 2 and 3). The harmonised MDS and EDS reflect the needs of two user levels. Firstly, the MDS and EDS should inform differential diagnosis and clinical decision making by presenting longitudinal data in a graphical dashboard summarising important outcomes at the point of care. The harmonised MDS will encompass demographics, functional and cognitive instruments, and rating scales. The harmonised EDS can answer specific questions and/or include additional functional and cognitive instruments to, for example, reflect local clinical practice and patient‐reported outcomes. Secondly, harmonised MDS and EDS facilitate collaboration between registries to, for example, benchmark, assess efficacy and important safety outcomes, and to inform health technology assessments. The harmonised data sets will be as lean as practical, undergo comprehensive beta‐testing by InRAD and the results shared with stakeholders. The presentation will explore the background to and need for data harmonisation across registries, the latest iteration of the harmonised MDS and EDS, and InRAD’s overall progress.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Dementia is a complex condition that affects individuals in various ways around the world, with a particularly high prevalence and incidence in low‐ to middle‐income countries. However, the majority of clinical trials on immunomodulators in Alzheimer’s disease have predominantly been conducted in specific geographic regions and populations. Our objective is to assess the diversity and inclusiveness of the participant samples in terminated phase 2 or 3 clinical trials for anti‐amyloid therapies. Method We performed a systematic review for completed and terminated phase 2 or 3 clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease in ClinicalTrials.gov with results published. We also searched for MEDLINE using “((anti‐amyloid) AND (alzheimer disease[MeSH Terms])) AND (therapy[MeSH Terms] OR (drug) OR (trial))”. We selected only trials using anti‐amyloid therapies regardless of the disease stage (Figure 1. Flowchart). We included all studies that provided sociodemographic characteristics of the sample studied. Variables collected were gender, race, countries where the trial was conducted, and mean years of education. Result A total of 16055 individuals over 12 trials were evaluated in this work (ENGAGE, EMERGE, GRADUATE I and II, CLARITY‐AD, A4, EXPEDITION3, ELN115727, CREAD and CREAD 2, TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 1 and 2). Gender was similarly distributed among studies (8911 females, 55.5%). Participants included were mostly white individuals (13664, 85.1%), with a minority of asian individuals (1259, 7.8%), and black individuals (202, 1.2%). Ethnic origins were demonstrated in 8 studies and only 774 (4.8%) individuals self‐reported as being hispanic. Studies were conducted in 164 countries taken altogether, but included only 25 (15.2%) low‐ and middle‐income countries. Conclusion Clinical trials using anti‐amyloid drugs have failed to represent the majority of individuals living with AD‐related cognitive impairment on a global scale. It ultimately increases the disparities presented in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with dementia. Ideally, anti‐amyloid trials should incorporate the epidemiology of individuals with dementia worldwide. These observations underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts involving scientists, societies, local governments, and industry to prioritize equity as a central goal in science.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) clinical trials led to the recent successes with monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid, which opens up many new directions for research into treatment for AD in the future. Gaining greater understanding from these successes and failures will help researchers to focus their efforts on avenues that have the highest potential benefit. Method We performed a meta‐analysis of over a hundred studies of 70+ AD treatments. A global statistical test (GST) combining ADAS‐cog, ADCS‐ADL and CDR‐sb was used to assess the overall efficacy in these studies, in a fair way across multiple outcomes. Disease modifying treatment effects and symptomatic effects impacting all disease symptoms will perform better on this GST than treatments impacting only one symptom. In addition, a false positive effect is less likely to occur on all 3 outcomes simultaneously, making the GST a more reliable outcome for detecting true treatment effects. Composite scores, ADCOMS and iADRS, were used to target true disease progression in the lecanemab and donanemab phase 2 studies, respectively, and have similar advantages to a GST. A similar approach would have possibly averted much of the controversy surrounding the aducanumab approval. Result Some studies that were previously determined to be failures show some indication of positive effects. And conversely, some studies previously thought to be promising are shown to be more clearly failures. Meta‐analyses combining similar treatments across programs illuminate overlooked mechanisms as well as more conclusive failures. Conclusion The success and failure of Alzheimer’s treatments is partly hidden by including 3 different domains of clinical efficacy: cognition, function and global. True treatment efficacy and true lack of efficacy are much easier to detect with multiple, combined outcomes.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial pathology, responsible for neurodegenerative disorders which in more than 60% of patients evolve into dementia. Comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology and the development of reliable diagnostic methods have made new and more effective therapies possible. In recent years, in addition to the classic anticholinesterases (AChEs), which can control the clinical symptoms of the disease, compounds able to reduce deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau (τ) protein aggregates, which are disease-modifying therapeutics (DMTs), have been studied. The results have shown that symptomatic therapy works best when administered in the disease's mild to moderate clinical phase. On the other hand, treatment with DMTs has been found to be more effective in the preclinical stage of AD, when Aβ and τ protein neurofibrillary tangles have not yet been compromised and patients still have a normal quality of life. This innovative approach requires the identification of specific biomarkers predictive of the disease, detectable many years before clinical signs are evident. Biomarkers allow early diagnosis, give indications of the possible development of dementia in the future, and make it possible to study the evolution of the disease. New scenarios, involving different pathways and approaches, could emerge and provide effective therapies to treat the very early stages of the disease and hamper its progression. The specific biomarkers studied so far have been reported here.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background There are no approved oral disease‐modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD). This study was intended to assess efficacy and safety of blarcamesine (ANAVEX®2‐73), an orally available small‐molecule activator of the sigma‐1 receptor (SIGMAR1) designed to exert neuroprotection through restoration of cellular homeostasis including autophagy enhancement. Method ANAVEX®2‐73‐AD‐004 is a multicenter (52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries), randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 48‐week phase 2b/3 trial that enrolled 508 participants with early AD (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia) from July 2018 to June 2021 (last patient visit in June 2022). Participants were randomized to receive blarcamesine (n = 338) or placebo (n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 weeks. The co‐primary cognitive and functional outcomes were the change in ADAS‐Cog13 and ADCS‐ADL scores from baseline to 48 weeks. Additional clinical outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR‐SB and the exploratory outcome CGI‐I. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Result The blarcamesine group demonstrated improvement compared to the placebo group in all clinical endpoints at 48 weeks: when comparing least‐squares mean (LSM) change in ADAS‐Cog13 score (difference, −1.783 [95% CI, −3.314 to −0.251]; P = 0.0226), LSM change in ADCS‐ADL score (difference, 1.019 [95% CI, −0.66 to 2.70]; P = 0.234), LSM change in CDR‐SB score (difference, −0.456 [95% CI, −0.831 to −0.080]; P = 0.0175), and LSM change in CGI‐I score (difference, −0.285 [95% CI, −0.474 to −0.095]; P = 0.0033). Participants with ≥1 serious treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine group and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. Common treatment‐emergent adverse events included dizziness, which was mostly mild to moderate in severity. Conclusion In this phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial, we found that among participants with early AD, blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression on prespecified primary outcome global and cognitive measures at 48 weeks in the ITT population. These results suggest that blarcamesine may be an effective, safe, and novel scalable oral treatment for early AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Anti‐amyloid immunotherapies modestly slow disease progression in early symptomatic AD; addition of other therapeutic modalities may be necessary to achieve larger treatment effects. Therapies that directly target tau can potentially produce substantial clinical benefit because the accumulation of insoluble tau protein is strongly correlated with the progression of AD. Which tau therapies are likely to be efficacious, whether or not to combine them with anti‐amyloid therapies, and which individuals are most likely to benefit are important unresolved questions that would require multiple parallel design trials to answer. Platform (umbrella) trials test multiple therapies in the same trial, allowing for substantial savings in time, cost and participant burden. Method ATP is a new NIH‐funded Phase 2 clinical trial platform that will be conducted as part of the AD Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC) in partnership with industry and philanthropic groups. The goal is to investigate the effects of tau therapies on the biological hallmarks of AD including insoluble and soluble tau species, amyloid and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration. ATP will initially evaluate two tau therapies alone or in combination with an anti‐amyloid therapy. 900 participants with late preclinical or early prodromal AD (CDR 0 or 0.5) will be randomized to six arms for two years of blinded treatment, followed by an optional open label extension (Figure 1). At least 20 percent of participants will be from underrepresented groups. The primary endpoint is 18F MK6240 tau PET, with key secondary endpoints including plasma P‐tau and MTBR243‐tau, amyloid PET and clinical assessments (CDR‐SB, PACC5). Inclusion criteria are based on plasma P‐tau217, clinical status and regional 18F MK6240 uptake. Result Two tau therapies and an anti‐amyloid therapy have been chosen for inclusion in ATP and startup is underway. The final design, choice of therapies and design as well as plans for inclusion of additional tau therapies after the trial begins and other details will be presented. Conclusion The ATP is a six arm factorial design platform trial that is planned to begin in late 2024 or early 2025 that will support efficient development of tau and combination therapies for early, sporadic AD.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to manage symptoms but have limited efficacy as the disease progresses. Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach. Despite its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, its efficacy and safety remain contentious, particularly following the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) rejection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of aducanumab in treating mild AD. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and Science Direct databases, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies focusing on aducanumab versus placebo in mild AD. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted on clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and neuroimaging markers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Out of 967 identified records, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated a dose-dependent reduction in Aβ plaques with aducanumab, but clinical outcomes varied. High-dose aducanumab (10 mg/kg) demonstrated significant improvements in some studies but not others. Adverse events, notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were frequent, especially at higher doses. The studies exhibited heterogeneous treatment effects and underscored the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as an alternative to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Aducanumab shows promise in reducing Aβ plaques and has potential clinical benefits at high doses; however, its safety profile, particularly concerning ARIA, remains a significant concern. The variability in clinical efficacy highlights the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment. Future studies should focus on refining treatment protocols and exploring alternative biomarkers to improve therapeutic outcomes for AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Neuropeptides are crucial proteins in the central nervous system, which significantly influence neurophysiological processes. This analysis explores cerebrospinal fluid alterations in Alzheimer's disease, offering insights to better understand the condition and explore novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Method We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus using specific search strategies. Following PRISMA guidelines, our screening and extraction included studies that investigated neuropeptide concentrations in Alzheimer's patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Utilizing the 'meta' R package, particularly the 'metacont' tool, we analyzed mean concentration levels and standard differences via the random effects model. Data pooling utilized inverse variance weighting, with I² and tau² assessing heterogeneity. The restricted maximum−likelihood estimator and Q−profile informed tau² and its confidence interval. The primary outcome was the mean difference in CSF neuropeptide levels between Alzheimer's patients and controls, considering reported units separately. Result In our analysis of neuropeptides across diverse studies involving Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and controls, we observed distinct neurochemical alterations. Somatostatin showed a significant mean difference of ‐15.48 pg/mL (95% CI: ‐20.95 to ‐10.01, I² = 89%) in 9 studies (141 AD, 203 controls), and ‐8.05 pmol/L difference (95% CI: ‐13.35 to ‐2.76, I² = 0%) in 2 studies (44 AD, 57 controls). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) showed ‐8.83 pg/mL difference (95% CI: ‐19.81 to 2.16, I² = 65%) in 5 studies (76 AD, 95 controls), and ‐16.85 pmol/L difference (95% CI: ‐35.21 to 1.52, I² = 71%) in 3 studies (87 AD, 62 controls). Orexin exhibited a difference of 8.03 pg/mL (8 studies: 235 AD, 177 controls; ‐2.60; 18.67, I² = 27%, p‐value: 0.14). After excluding a study that significantly reduced heterogeneity, the adjusted result was 12.77 (95% CI: 1.16 ‐ 24.39, p‐value: 0.03). Substance P also showed a reduction in mean difference by ‐16.52 pg/mL (2 studies: 45 AD, 35 controls; ‐67.47; 34.42, I² = 87%) but was not statistically significant. Conclusion Somatostatin exhibited a consistent decrease in levels across studies, indicating potential relevance to AD pathophysiology. Additionally, orexin demonstrated a significant increase in levels in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's.">

Methods All articles and reviews pertaining to rehabilitation treatment in Alzheimer’s disease from 2000 to 2023 were downloaded through Web of Science Core Collection. The results were subjected to bibliometric analysis using Microsoft Excel (2019 version), CiteSpace (6.3 R1 Advanced) and VOSviewer 1.6.20. Results Overall, 1,284 publications were included. The number of publications was increasing yearly. The United States has published the most publications. University of Toronto has published the most papers of all institutions. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION and ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION were the journals with the most studies and the most commonly cited, respectively. Clare L is the author with the highest productivity and co-citation. After analysis, the most common keywords are mild cognitive impairment, cognitive, impairment memory and executive function indicates that cognitive impairment is the main focus of research. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, cognitive rehabilitation, and physical activity/exercise are the hotspots of research at the present stage and are likely to continue. Conclusion Distinguishing non pharmacological treatments at different stages of development is a research hotspot in AD rehabilitation; Sports intervention, brain functional imaging techniques represented by brain functional connectivity, virtual reality, and quality of life are research directions that need attention.">

        <tr id="Abstract A 10 mg/kg every 2 week (Q2W) dose of the humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody lecanemab was approved after demonstrating significant clinical benefit in slowing cognitive decline in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in two clinical studies (the phase 2 Study 201 and phase 3 Clarity AD). A less frequent every 4 weeks lecanemab 10 mg/kg maintenance dosing (Q4W) has been proposed after a sufficient initial Q2W treatment. To further understand long‐term benefit of continued Q4W lecanemab treatment, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model was developed which mechanistically describes AD pathophysiology using multivariate data from clinical studies. The population QSP model incorporated 3 interlinked modules describing Aβ pathway, tau pathology and cognitive decline, where Aβ triggers tau pathology and tau pathology leads to cognitive decline due to neuronal damage and degeneration. The model was developed using nonlinear mixed‐effect modeling and was successfully validated using a multivariate dataset (N = 4057) consisting of amyloid PET, CDR‐SB, ADAS‐Cog14, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and ptau181, and tau PET data from the lecanemab trials, as well as amyloid PET, ADAS‐Cog and CDR‐SB data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Simulations were conducted to investigate long‐term lecanemab benefits with Q4W dosing following the initial lecanemab Q2W treatment. QSP simulations showed additional benefits gained across clinical outcomes, amyloid plaque and protofibrils, Tau PET, and plasma biomarkers with continued lecanemab treatment beyond 18 months. Specifically, maintenance lecanemab continued to reduce brain amyloid plaques and protofibrils in subjects who did not reach amyloid negativity following the initial 18‐month Q2W lecanemab. Simulations showed plasma ptau‐181 continued to decline and plasma Ab42/40 ratio continued to increase with Q4W maintenance dosing. Furthermore, simulations showed continued suppression of tau PET, and additional reductions in cognitive decline (CDR‐SB, ADAS‐Cog14) with Q4W maintenance dosing. Sustained protofibril clearance was indicated as a key driver for long‐term (>18 months) lecanemab effect on halting tau pathology and slowing cognitive decline, particularly after plaques are cleared following initial lecanemab Q2W treatment. QSP simulations demonstrated the importance of continuing lecanemab treatment after plaque removal and support Q4W maintenance dosing following initial treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The A4 Study (NCT02008357) was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 trial, assessing the safety and efficacy of solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We previously reported on the baseline regional flortaucipir (FTP) profiles in this study1. Here, we present the longitudinal tau profiles. Methods FTP scans were acquired at baseline and weeks 84,168, and 240. All FTP scans were analyzed using an established image processing pipeline to evaluate global[2] and regional tau patterns in template space. Global tau level was measured using an AD‐signature weighted volume‐of‐interest (VOI) (tauSUVR)2. Regional tau uptake and accumulation were measured in 3 prespecified composite regions representing tau pathology in preclinical AD, ordered by hypothetical pathologic spreading: 1) “early” (amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus), 2) “middle” (fusiform, inferior, and middle temporal, and inferior parietal gyri), and 3) “late” (lateral occipital, posterior cingulate, superior parietal, and supramarginal gyri). We evaluated associations between baseline amyloid burden, age, sex, APOE ε4 carriage and longitudinal tau change within placebo group. Results At baseline, a lower tau signal was observed generally in regions identified later in pathologic sequences. Longitudinal change was region‐ and visit‐specific. In both treatment groups, the early and middle regions showed the largest change from baseline at Week 84; the middle region showed the largest change at Weeks 168 and 240; the global assessment changes were smaller than the early and middle regions at each time point (Figure 1; Tables 1&2) and a majority of participants remained global “tau negative”3(tauSUVR<1.11 Figure 2) throughout the trial. Higher baseline global amyloid level was most strongly associated with increased tau PET signal in the prespecified middle composite region at all timepoints (Figure 3). Conclusion A multi‐regional composite VOI staging scheme was developed using baseline tau profiles and prespecified for analysis of longitudinal tau PET images. Results confirmed that cognitively unimpaired, amyloid positive participants demonstrate larger tau accumulation in the early and middle than late and neocortical regions. The early composite performed better at detecting tau accumulation initially and middle composite at later timepoints. This multi‐regional staging scheme appears to be useful to characterize tau progression in this preclinical AD cohort.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background By inhibiting the translation of neurotoxic aggregating proteins ‐ amyloid precursor protein, tau, alpha‐synuclein etc., buntanetap restores axonal transport, lowers inflammation, and protects nerve cells from dying. Our Phase2 studies showed that buntanetap improved early AD patients ADAS‐Cog11 after a month treatment. We conducted a phase 2/3 study of buntanetap in over 300 mild to moderate AD patients (MMSE14‐24) to verify the findings. Method Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled dose‐ranging phase 2/3 study to test buntanetap’s efficacy and safety in mild to moderate AD patients. Result Patients were dosed with placebo, 7.5mg, 15mg and 30 mg QD buntanetap. A total of 353 patients were enrolled, and 325 patients completed the study across 54 sites in the US. Primary endpoints are ADAS‐Cog11 and ADCS‐CGIC. Consistent with what we have observed before, buntanetap is very safe and well‐tolerated. Comparable numbers of adverse events (AEs) between treatment and placebo groups were observed. No serious AEs were related to buntanetap. During the past year, commercial plamsa biomarker has advanced to the point that is comparable or superior to CSF biomarker and PET scan. We decided to use plasma biomarker to confirm the Alzheimer diagnosis. 202 patients were biomarker positive, identified as pTau217/npTau>4.2%. For the biomarker positive AD patients, 112 were moderate AD (MMSE 14‐20) and 90 were mild AD (MMSE21‐24). We found that buntanetap statistically significantly improved ADAS‐Cog11 in mild AD patients. After 3 months of treatment, all three buntanetap treatment groups showed statistically significantly improvement from their corresponding baseline (7.5mg improved 2.19 (0.87), p = 0.013; 15mg improved 2.79 (0.81), p = 0.001; 30mg improved 3.32 (0.82), P<0.001). Both 15mg and 30mg groups also had a statistically significantly improvement relative to placebo group. We didn’t observe a statistically significant difference in CGIC. In accordance with the mechanism of action of buntanetap, we observed a reduction in plasma np‐Tau (non‐phosphorylated Tau) after treatment, providing further credence to buntanetap’s efficacy and mechanism of action. Conclusion This short study shows a symptomatic effect with a possible disease‐modification trend according to the tau data. The next study will have a longer duration, improved design and be statistically powered to validate symptomatic improvement and disease‐modification.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Liraglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analogue licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Preclinical evidence in transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease suggests that liraglutide exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing amyloid oligomers, normalising synaptic plasticity and cerebral glucose uptake, and increasing the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. Method This is a multi‐centre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase IIb trial of liraglutide in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia, conducted at several centres in the UK. As a part of this study, MRI brain scans of all patients were performed at baseline and after 12 months treatment with liraglutide or matching placebo along with neuropsychometric evaluation and [18F]FDG PET. A total of 204 Alzheimer’s participants were randomised to receive either liraglutide or placebo as a daily subcutaneous injection for 12 months. All subjects had regular clinical visits and neuropsychometric evaluation at regular intervals. Repeat scans were performed in all subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment. Volumetric changes from baseline to follow‐up in MRI scans were evaluated using both regional volume analysis and voxel‐based morphometric analysis. Result MRI analysis demonstrated a slower decline of temporal lobe volume and total grey matter volume in liraglutide‐treated patients compared to the placebo group. Voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) analysis demonstrated that liraglutide‐treated participants showed a slower reduction in whole cortical grey matter, frontal, temporal and parietal lobe volume in participants treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. This was associated with slower decline in cognitive function.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), is an FDA‐approved drug to treat these neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). AChEIs are able to stabilize or slow decline in cognition, function, and behavior. Our objective is to investigate whether Donepezil is able to significantly reduce the rate of hippocampal (Hip) atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. Methods We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines during the preparation of this systematic review. We searched in MEDLINE (PubMed), CENTRAL (Cochrane Library, November 2023), SCOPUS, and Web of Science and included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing 10 mg donepezil‐treated with donepezil‐untreated (placebo) and/without control in terms of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow up visits’ results. Results A total of four studies out of 174 met our inclusion criteria (599 participants; donepezil = 281, placebo = 318), two of them were ADs and the others were MCIs. 323 participants were female (representing 53.92% of included study population). Follow up between baseline and endpoint results was 12 months. Available outcome data cover reduction of hippocampal atrophy rate in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, but data on several outcome dimensions were either unavailable or not consistently reported across all studies. Results concluded from studies been conducted on MCI patients were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) annual percentage of change (APC) of Hip volume at 12 months compared to placebo, but studies on AD patients indicated statistically significant APC of Hip volume at 24 and 50 weeks (P < 0.001), but one of these studies also reported no significant difference in neuropsychological performance between treatment groups. Conclusion The findings of this review suggest that donepezil reducing hippocampal atrophy rate was statistically insignificant for MCI and statistically significant for AD, but its clinical significance is questionable until further investigations. It is also important to note that while the data provided insights into the impact of donepezil, there were limitations, such as incomplete reporting of outcome dimensions in some studies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mivelsiran (ALN‐APP) is an investigational, intrathecally administered RNA interference therapeutic designed to lower levels of amyloid‐β (Aβ) peptide, a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) pathogenesis, by reducing upstream production of amyloid precursor protein (APP). We report additional safety, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker data from the double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, single ascending dose part of the ongoing mivelsiran Phase 1 study (NCT05231785). Method Patients with early‐onset AD (symptom onset <65 years of age, Clinical Dementia Rating global score 0.5 or 1.0, and Mini‐Mental State Examination score >20) were randomized to single intrathecal doses of mivelsiran (25mg, 50mg, or 75mg) or placebo and evaluated for 6 months (plus up to 6‐months follow‐up if needed to achieve washout). Primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events (AEs). Pharmacological effects of mivelsiran (secondary endpoints) and exploratory biomarkers of disease progression were also evaluated. Result As of November 16, 2023, 20 patients (mean [range] age, 61.3 [53–73] years; 60.0% male; 80.0% white) were randomized to mivelsiran or placebo in 25mg (N = 6, 2:1 randomization), 50mg (N = 8, 3:1), and 75mg (N = 6, 2:1) cohorts. In these pooled cohorts, AEs were reported in 19 patients (95.0%), all of mild or moderate severity (Table 1). One patient experienced two mild AEs that were considered both study drug and procedure related. No serious AEs or deaths occurred. Reductions from baseline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble APPα and APPβ levels were rapid and sustained through ongoing data capture (i.e., Month 6 with mivelsiran 50mg and Month 10 with mivelsiran 75mg; Table 2), and were accompanied by sustained reductions from baseline in CSF Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels available through Month 6 (Table 3). Safety and pharmacodynamic data of up to 6 months from additional mivelsiran dose cohorts will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion In this ongoing Phase 1 single ascending dose study, mivelsiran 50mg and 75mg were well tolerated and produced robust, durable reductions in CSF levels of soluble APP and downstream Aβ42 and Aβ40, key proteins implicated in progression of AD and CAA. These interim results support further evaluation of mivelsiran in patients with AD or CAA.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The sigma‐2 receptor (S2R) modulator CT1812 is a first‐in‐class investigational therapeutic, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomers from synapses and clears them from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid, restoring cognitive performance in a transgenic mouse model of AD. To investigate the mechanism of action of CT1812 and enable biomarker discovery, a phosphoproteomic analysis of CSF samples from SHINE‐A was performed. Method SHINE is a Phase 2 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of CT1812 for 6‐months in mild to moderate AD patients (NCT03507790), and an interim analysis was performed on the first 24 patients enrolled (SHINE‐A). Tandem‐mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT‐MS) proteomics and phosphoproteomics were performed on baseline and end‐of‐study CSF samples from SHINE‐A (n = 18) and differential abundance (CT1812 vs placebo; p≤0.05) was assessed. STRING pathway analyses (v 12.0) and comparative analyses between differentially abundant proteins and phosphoproteins were conducted (p≤0.05, p≤0.1). Pearson correlation analyses with altered phosphopeptides and CSF Aβ42 and ADAS‐Cog‐11 were performed. An independent cohort from the SPARC trial assessing the effect of CT1812 in AD patients (NCT03493282) was used for clinical validation of findings. Result Altered phosphoproteins identified in SHINE‐A CSF samples included AD‐related proteins, APOE (p≤0.05), CHGB, SPARCL1, and SPP1 (p≤0.1). STRING pathway analysis underlined the role of CT1812 in altering key pathways: “vesicle trafficking”, “regulation of neurofibrillary tangle assembly”, “amyloid fibril formation”, and “low‐density lipoprotein particle receptor catabolic process”, these findings replicated in the SPARC independent cohort. Comparative analyses with proteomic data indicated that 2 phosphoproteins were differentially abundant at the protein level: APOE and MEPE (p≤0.1). Correlation analyses between the phosphoproteome and CSF Aβ42 and ADAS‐Cog‐11 identified highly correlated proteins, APOL1, CHGB, SERPINA10, and TALDO1 (p≤0.05). Conclusion The altered phosphorylated proteins and pathways affected by CT1812 highlight a potential impact of CT1812 in modulating amyloid, trafficking, and LDL biology, all pathways dysregulated in AD. Overall, findings support proof of mechanisms of action of CT1812 and the continued clinical development of CT1812.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SHINE (NCT03507790, COG0201) is a Phase 2 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled 6‐month trial, conducted to study the effect of the sigma‐2 receptor (S2R) modulator CT1812 in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An unbiased assessment of CSF proteomes from the patients that completed the SHINE trial was performed to identify pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers of target/pathway engagement and disease modification for CT1812. Method Tandem‐mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT‐MS) CSF proteomics was performed on baseline and end of study samples from an analysis of SHINE Part A and B to test the effects of two doses (100 mg, 300 mg; given orally, once daily) of CT1812 compared to placebo in mild to moderate AD patients. Change from baseline was calculated for each participant (N = 47), and differential abundance analysis (CT1812 vs placebo) was performed to assess treatment effects followed by Brain network mapping, Gene Ontology, and pathway analyses using STRING and Metacore (p≤0.1, p≤0.05). Pearson correlation analyses across levels of proteomic proteins and AD core biomarkers were also performed. Result In the interim analysis of the first 24 patients (SHINE‐A), differential expression analyses identified proteins altered (p≤0.1 and p≤0.05) in CT1812 vs placebo CSF, and hierarchical clustering demonstrated stratification of patients by treatment. Comparisons to reference standards showed proteins disrupted in or genetically linked to AD that were impacted by CT1812. Proteins dysregulated in AD were found to be normalized with CT1812 treatment (i.e., CLU) and biomarkers of pathway engagement were identified (i.e., APP, NPC1). Brain network mapping and pathway analysis identified statistically significant biological processes altered by CT1812, including those related to synapses, lipoprotein and amyloid beta biology, and neuroinflammation. Analyses of SHINE‐A and ‐B combined (N = 47) will be presented at this meeting. Conclusion CSF biomarker findings of the completed SHINE trial extend beyond that previously identified in the interim Part A analysis and shed light on potential biological proteins and/or pathways affected by CT1812. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers of CT1812 pathway engagement and disease modification were identified. Future investigation is warranted to determine if findings replicate in independent cohorts of AD patients.">

Only anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibody drugs that have completed at least a phase 2 trial were included. This class of drugs included, aducanumab, bapineuzumab, crenezumab, donanemab, gantenerumab, lecanemab, ponezumab, semorinemab, and solanezumab. We focused on two outcome measures that were most frequently reported ‐ CDR‐SB and ADAS‐Cog. Nearly all trials reported the post‐treatment difference between drug and placebo, i.e., the difference between scores of the treatment relative to the placebo at the end of the trial. On a scale where a higher score is “worse,” a negative (‐) difference “favors” treatment (lower score – higher score = ‐ value). We use bootstrapping methodology, a machine‐learning statistical procedure that resamples from a single dataset (with replacement) to create multiple samples. This resampling distribution allows for the calculation of means, median, standard errors, confidence intervals (CI), and other statistics. The means and 95%CI of these published differences were estimated by performing 10,000 resamples. Result All the clinical trials analyzed were randomized, placebo controlled. Sample sizes varied for the phase 3 trials, from 253 to 1072 per arm (median = 519 participants); trial lengths were from 76 to 105 weeks (median = 78 weeks). The estimated bootstrap mean and 95%CI for differences between placebo and drug, for CDR‐SB and for ADAS‐Cog were: CDR‐SB; mean (95%CI) = ‐0.08 (‐0.31 to +0.22), range of differences = ‐0.70 to 1.30; ADAS‐Cog; mean (95%CI) = ‐0.53 (‐1.03 to +0.22), range of differences = ‐1.60 to +4.74. Conclusion The cumulative mean changes for CDR‐SB were ‐0.08; for ADAS‐Cog it was ‐0.53, with both 95%CI including zero. The score range for CDR‐SB is 0 to 18; the range for ADAS‐Cog is 0 to 70/90. These mean differences across the many trials conducted cannot be considered to be either clinically or statistically significant.">

        <tr id="Background NMDAR antibody encephalitis (NMDAR-Ab-E) can have an onset during, after, or prior to a pregnancy. In animal models, transplacental NMDAR-IgG transfer can affect neurodevelopment. In contrast, clinical reports of mothers affected by NMDAR-Ab-E typically are reassuring. We systematically reviewed maternal, infant, and childhood clinical data pertaining to NMDAR-Ab-E with an onset before, during, or after pregnancy and compared this to our single autoimmune neurology centre experience. Methods After pre-registration on PROSPERO (CRD42023408447), we searched PubMed and Scopus for NMDAR-Ab-E case reports/series with an onset before, during, or after pregnancy (last search 19/10/2023). We extracted maternal, neonatal, and childhood outcomes using an idealised checklist to derive summary statistics. Results After quality control we identified 66 pregnancies in 61 women from 48 reports or series. 72% of women recovered with minimal or no neurological deficits, comparable to non-pregnancy associated NMDAR-Ab-E. Likewise, 80% of pregnancies resulted in livebirths with a single neonatal death reported. Data on neonatal outcome measures were frequently unreported and childhood follow-up in only 60%. Our centre's experience is consistent: 3/4 mothers recovered with no functional deficits and 7/8 children without evidence of compromise at median of two years follow-up. Conclusions Current evidence does not overall suggest unfavourable maternal, fetal, or childhood outcomes after NMDAR-Ab-E. However, the available sample is small, predominantly single case reports with modest follow-up, lacks standardisation, and data are often incomplete. Future approaches should address these caveats; developing multi-centre collaboration towards an international registry.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Irsenontrine (e2027) is a potent and selective PDE9 inhibitor that increases cellular cGMP which is important for glutamatergic synaptic function. Irsenontrine was investigated to improve cognition in Lewy Body Dementia (LBD; DLB and PDD), and recent phase 2 study data suggests that irsenontrine could be more effective in DLB patients without amyloid copathology. Here, we evaluated differential change from baseline levels in proteins associated with cGMP pathway in DLB participants without amyloid co‐pathology (DLB A‐) compared to DLB participants with amyloid co‐pathology (DLB A+). We next evaluated the affected biological pathways. Method We employed proximity extension analysis (PEA) proteomics in all available paired pre‐ and post‐treatment CSF samples of a translational medicine trial of E2027 (Figure 1A). This set included six DLB A‐ patients (CSF Lumipulse Ab42/40 cut‐off 0.057) and nine DLB CSF A+ patients with a mean±sd age of 76±6 years and 67% male. We assessed the treatment effect per DLB group by paired Wilcoxon tests of pre‐ vs post‐treatment (1) protein levels (p<0.05) and (2) individual pathway enrichment z‐scores based on 189 KEGG pathways (p<0.05). Result Following E2027 treatment, CSF protein changes were apparent in both groups (DLB A‐ 10 proteins increased, and 32 decreased; DLB A+ 16 proteins increased, and 27 decreased; Figure 1B/C). We found that more pathways were affected in DLB A‐ (5 pathways), compared to DLB A+ (3 pathways), and several of these were related to the mechanism of action, including an increase in Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis z‐scores in both groups, and lower GABAergic synapse in DLB A‐ only (Figure 1D/E). Conclusion This global proteomics analyses in DLB clinical trial samples presents that, despite the small number of participants treated with E2027, there were changes in proteins related to the mechanism of action, as indicated by Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis increase, which amongst others factors related to glutamate metabolism. In addition, multiple proteins and pathways were differentially affected between the DLB A‐ and A+ group, which could lead to improved understanding of differential clinical treatment response in DLB patients.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates whether exposition to levodopa/carbidopa (LA/CA) medication is associated with modified Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectories. METHODS: Multivariate analysis used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker information included in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set for subjects with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DE). Survival analyses examined the progression to MCI/DE and death events. RESULTS: LA/CA use is associated with lower levels of CSF amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total Tau. After adjusting for age, sex and APOE {varepsilon}4 allele presence, that effect was quantified by negative coefficients of the fitted linear mixed models - P values <0.01 in all cases except for P-tau in the MCI subgroup (P=0.02). No similar effects were identified for other antiparkinsonian drugs. Exposition to LA/CA decreased the progression from MCI to DE (P=0.03). DISCUSSION: The identified effects of LA/CA exposition on AD biomarkers and progression deserve further investigation in controlled clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Objective: To investigate the levels of β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in serum of patients with Alzheimer 's disease (AD) and the relationship between them. Methods: A case-control study was conducted to select 73 patients with AD who were hospitalized in Beijing Huilongguan Hospital from November 2023 to February 2024 as AD group, and 70 healthy controls (HC) were selected as HC group. The basic information of all subjects and the clinical information of AD patients were collected, and the levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL were detected and compared between the two groups. The effects of Aβ1-42 and TBIL on AD were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between TBIL and Aβ1-42 in AD group and HC group. According to the level of Aβ1-42 in AD patients, they were divided into Aβ1-42 elevated group and Aβ1-42 normal group. The differences of clinical data and TBIL levels between the two groups were compared. According to the quartile of TBIL in AD patients, they were divided into Q1 group, Q2 group, Q3 group and Q4 group. The correlation between TBIL and the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation was analyzed by binary logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to analyze the ability of TBIL level to predict the increase of Aβ1-42 in AD patients. Results: There was no significant difference in gender, marital status, education level, smoking and drinking between AD group and HC group (P>0.05), while the levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL and age in AD group were significantly higher than those in HC group [101.10(71.20, 128.60) pg/ml/22.40(10.00, 39.60) pg/ml, Z=-8.714, P<0.001;(11.00±3.22/8.07±3.00) μmol/L, t=5.621, P<0.001;(77.14±8.20/68.30±10.27) years, t=5.672, P<0.001]. For AD patients, the TBIL level in the Aβ1-42 elevated group was lower than that in the Aβ1-42 normal group [(10.05±2.94/11.66±3.28) μmol/L, t=-2.148, P=0.035], while there was no significant difference in other demographic and clinical data between the two groups (P>0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that higher levels of Aβ1-42 (OR=1.021, 95%CI：1.010-1.032) and TBIL (OR=1.505, 95%CI：1.249-1.814), older age (OR=1.083, 95%CI：1.020-1.150) and female (OR=4.348, 95%CI：1.253-15.094) were risk factors for AD. Correlation analysis showed that TBIL was negatively correlated with Aβ1-42 in AD patients (r=-0.322, P=0.006). After adjusting the relevant covariates, binary logistic regression showed that compared with AD patients in Q1 group, the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation in AD patients in Q4 group was lower (OR=0.052, 95%CI：0.005-0.535, P<0.05), and TBIL was negatively correlated with the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation (P trend<0.05). ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of TBIL in predicting the increase of Aβ1-42 in AD patients was 0.642. Conclusion: The levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL in AD patients were higher, and the level of TBIL was negatively correlated with the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapeutic vaccines are used to strengthen a patient’s own immune system by amplifying existing immune responses. Intralesional administration of the bacteria-based emm55 vaccine together with the PD1 checkpoint inhibitor produced a strong anti-tumor effect against the B16 melanoma murine model. However, it is not trivial to design an optimal order and frequency of injections for combination therapies. Here, we developed a coupled ordinary differential equations model calibrated to experimental data and used the mesh adaptive direct search method to optimize the treatment protocols of the emm55 vaccine and anti-PD1 combined therapy. This method determined that early consecutive vaccine injections combined with distributed anti-PD1 injections of decreasing separation time yielded the best tumor size reduction. The optimized protocols led to a twofold decrease in tumor area for the vaccine-alone treatment, and a fourfold decrease for the combined therapy. Our results reveal the tumor subpopulation dynamics in the optimal treatment condition, defining the path for efficacious treatment design. Similar computational frameworks can be applied to other tumors and other combination therapies to generate experimentally testable hypotheses in a fairly unrestricted and inexpensive setting.">

        <tr id="Effective cancer therapies must address the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex network of tumor cells and stromal components, including endothelial, immune, and mesenchymal cells. Durable outcomes require targeting both tumor cells and the TME while minimizing systemic toxicity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based therapies have shown efficacy in cancers such as metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but are limited by severe side effects. Innovative IL-2-based immunotherapeutic approaches include immunotoxins, such as antibody–drug conjugates, immunocytokines, and antibody–cytokine fusion proteins that enhance tumor-specific delivery. These strategies activate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, eliciting a potent Th1-mediated anti-tumor response. Modified IL-2 variants with reduced Treg cell activity further improve specificity and reduce immunosuppression. Additionally, IL-2 conjugates with peptides or anti-angiogenic agents offer improved therapeutic profiles. Combining IL-2-based therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), anti-angiogenic agents, or radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies highlight reduced toxicity and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, overcoming TME-driven immune suppression. These approaches mitigate the limitations of high-dose soluble IL-2 therapy, promoting immune activation and minimizing adverse effects. This review critically explores advances in IL-2-based therapies, focusing on immunotoxins, immunocytokines, and IL-2 derivatives. Emphasis is placed on their role in combination strategies, showcasing their potential to target the TME and improve clinical outcomes effectively. Also, the use of IL-2 immunocytokines in “in situ” vaccination to relieve the immunosuppression of the TME is discussed.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal cancers worldwide. Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg. TIM-3 and LAG-3), have shown potential to reverse NK cell exhaustion in preclinical studies. This article explores the promise of these innovative strategies in HCC immunotherapy, providing new therapeutic directions for optimizing NK cell function and improving drug sensitivity.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to combat cancer, marking a significant advancement in treatment. This review traces its evolution from the late 19th century to its current status. It began with William Coley’s pioneering work using bacterial toxins to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells, establishing the foundational concept of immunotherapy. In the mid-20th century, cytokine therapies like interferons and interleukins emerged, demonstrating that altering the immune response could reduce tumors and highlighting the complex interplay between cancer and the immune system. The discovery of immune checkpoints, regulatory pathways that prevent autoimmunity but are exploited by cancer cells to evade detection, was a pivotal development. Another major breakthrough is CAR-T cell therapy, which involves modifying a patient’s T cells to target cancer-specific antigens. This personalized treatment has shown remarkable success in certain blood cancers. Additionally, cancer vaccines aim to trigger immune responses against tumor-specific or associated antigens, and while challenging, ongoing research is improving their efficacy. The historical progression of cancer immunotherapy, from Coley’s toxins to modern innovations like checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, underscores its transformative impact on cancer treatment. As research delves deeper into the immune system’s complexities, immunotherapy is poised to become even more crucial in oncology, offering renewed hope to patients globally.">

        <tr id="The response rates to immunotherapy vary widely depending on the type of cancer and the specific treatment used and can be disappointingly low for many solid tumors. Fortunately, due to their complementary mechanisms of action, immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy have synergistic effects in cancer treatment. By normalizing the tumor vasculature, anti-angiogenic therapy can improve blood flow and oxygenation to facilitate better immune cell infiltration into the tumor and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. It also reduces immunosuppressive factors and enhances immune activation, to create a more favorable environment for immune cells to attack the tumor. Their combination leverages the strengths of both therapies to enhance anti-tumor effects and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="The emergence of effective immunotherapies has revolutionized therapies for many types of cancer. However, current immunotherapy has limited efficacy in certain patient populations and displays therapeutic resistance after a period of treatment. To address these challenges, a growing number of immunotherapy drugs have been investigated in clinical and preclinical applications. The diverse functionality of peptides has made them attractive as a therapeutic modality, and the global market for peptide-based therapeutics is witnessing significant growth. Peptides can act as immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many malignant cancers. However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between different peptides and the host’s immune system remains unclear. This review describes in detail the roles of peptides in regulating the function of the immune system for cancer immunotherapy. Initially, we systematically elaborate on the relevant mechanisms of cancer immunotherapy. Subsequently, we categorize peptide-based nanomaterials into the following three categories: peptide-based vaccines, anti-cancer peptides, and peptide-based delivery systems. We carefully analyzed the roles of these peptides in overcoming the current barriers in immunotherapy, including multiple strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of peptide vaccines, the synergistic effect of anti-cancer peptides in combination with other immune agents, and peptide assemblies functioning as immune stimulators or vehicles to deliver immune agents. Furthermore, we introduce the current status of peptide-based immunotherapy in clinical applications and discuss the weaknesses and future prospects of peptide-based materials for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, this review aims to enhance comprehension of the potential applications of peptide-based materials in cancer immunotherapy and lay the groundwork for future research and clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with conventional treatments offering limited effectiveness in advanced stages, due to distant metastases and treatment resistance. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have shown promise, but their efficacy as standalone therapies are often insufficient. This has led to increased interest in combining ICIs with radiotherapy, known as radioimmunotherapy (iRT), to enhance treatment outcomes. This review explores the mechanisms that underlie the synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiotherapy can induce the “abscopal effect”, eliciting systemic immune responses that reduce tumor burdens outside the treated area. It also increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on tumor cells, improving immune recognition. Furthermore, radiotherapy can modify the tumor microenvironment by inducing metabolic reprogramming to bolster anti-tumor immunity. We discuss strategies for optimizing iRT, including considerations of radiation doses, fractionation schedules, and treatment site selection, which significantly influence immune responses by enhancing MHC-I expression or promoting T-cell infiltration. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of iRT in NSCLC and other cancers, though challenges in standardizing treatment protocols and managing side effects persist. Overall, radioimmunotherapy presents a promising approach to improving NSCLC treatment outcomes. Ongoing research into its mechanisms and the refinement of treatment may reshape clinical practice, offering more effective and personalized options for patients with advanced lung cancer. Further studies are essential to validate these findings and optimize therapeutic protocols.">

Combination therapies appear to be the most promising solution, as they target multiple molecular pathways involved in GBM progression. One area of growing interest is the incorporation of phytotherapy and micotherapy as complementary treatments, which offer potential benefits due to their anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor outcomes due to frequent recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. A major contributor to this resistance is the tumor’s ability to suppress natural killer (NK) cells, which are key players in the immune system’s fight against cancer. In PDAC, the tumor microenvironment (TME) creates conditions that impair NK cell function, including reduced proliferation, weakened cytotoxicity, and limited tumor infiltration. This review examines how interactions between tumor-derived factors, NK cells, and the TME contribute to tumor progression and treatment resistance. To address these challenges, we propose a new “Triple NK Cell Biomarker Approach”. This strategy focuses on identifying biomarkers from three critical areas: tumor characteristics, TME factors, and NK cell suppression mechanisms. This approach could guide personalized treatments to enhance NK cell activity. Additionally, we highlight the potential of combining NK cell-based therapies with conventional treatments and repurposed drugs to improve outcomes for PDAC patients. While progress has been made, more research is needed to better understand NK cell dysfunction and develop effective therapies to overcome these barriers.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, capitalizing on the unique ability of dendritic cells to initiate and regulate immune responses by presenting antigens to T-cells. These vaccines work by isolating dendritic cells from a patient, loading them with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and reinfusing them to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells. The FDA approval of sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for metastatic prostate cancer in 2010 marked a significant milestone in the field, demonstrating the potential for DC vaccines to prolong survival in cancer patients. This review explores the mechanism of action of dendritic cell vaccines, focusing on the process of antigen loading, dendritic cell maturation, and T-cell activation. It also discusses current clinical applications, challenges such as antigen selection, tumor immune evasion, and the high complexity of vaccine production. Future prospects for DC vaccines include personalized cancer vaccines, improved antigen delivery methods, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance effectiveness. Dendritic cell vaccines offer a novel and potentially durable approach to cancer treatment, but further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and broaden their application across various cancer types and other diseases.

The article emphasizes the benefits of combining activated lymphocyte therapy with existing treatments like radiation therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, and chemotherapy to improve efficacy and reduce resistance. What are the implications of the main finding? Various cell types like natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes contribute to immune responses that assist in eliminating cancer cells. The potential research gaps are identified, and a wider adoption of immune cell therapy as a component of combination strategies for the treatment of lung cancer is proposed. The article highlights ongoing research into the tumor microenvironment and its role in immune evasion, suggesting that targeting these mechanisms could boost treatment success, and discusses the significance of clinical trials in validating the effectiveness of activated lymphocyte therapies and the importance of real-world evidence in guiding clinical practice. Abstract This review explores the significance and prospects of using diverse T-cell variants in the context of combined therapy for lung cancer treatment. Recently, there has been an increase in research focused on understanding the critical role of tumor-specific T lymphocytes and the potential benefits of autologous T-cell-based treatments for individuals with lung cancer. One promising approach involves intravenous administration of ex vivo-activated autologous lymphocytes to improve the immune status of patients with cancer. Investigations are also exploring the factors that influence the success of T-cell therapy and the methods used to stimulate them. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of activated lymphocytes and deciphering the mechanisms underlying their activation of innate anti-tumor immunity will pave the way for numerous clinical trials and the development of innovative strategies for cancer therapy like combined immunotherapy and radiation therapy.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy is a cutting-edge approach that leverages sophisticated technology to target tumor-specific antibodies and modulate the immune system to eradicate cancer and enhance patients' quality of life. Bioinformatics and genetic science advancements have made it possible to diagnose and treat cancer patients using immunotherapy technology. However, current immunotherapies against cancer have limited clinical benefits due to cancer-associated antigens, which often fail to interact with immune cells and exhibit insufficient therapeutic targeting with unintended side effects. To surmount this challenge, nanoparticle systems have emerged as a potential strategy for transporting immunotherapeutic agents to cancer cells and activating immune cells to combat tumors. Consequently, this process potentially generates an antigen-specific T cells response that effectively suppresses cancer growth. Furthermore, nanoplatforms have high specificity, efficacy, diagnostic potential, and imaging capabilities, making them promising tools for cancer treatment. However, this informative paper delves into the various available immunotherapies, including CAR T cells therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, cytokines, cancer vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the paper delves into the concept of theragnostic nanotechnology, which integrates therapy and diagnostics for a more personalized treatment approach for cancer therapy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy describes a class of therapies in which the immune system is manipulated for therapeutic benefit. These treatments include immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, and vaccines. For many hematological malignancies, immunotherapy has emerged as an essential treatment component. However, this success has yet to be replicated for solid tumors, which develop advanced physical and molecular mechanisms for suppressing and evading immune destruction. Nevertheless, cytokine immunotherapy presents a potential remedy to these barriers by delivering a proinflammatory immune signal to the tumor and thereby transforming it from immunologically “cold” to “hot.” Interleukin‐12 (IL‐12), one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines, was initially investigated for this purpose. However, initial murine and human studies in which IL‐12 was administered systemically resulted in dangerous immunotoxicity associated with off‐target immune activation. As a result, recent studies have employed advanced cell and molecular engineering approaches to reduce IL‐12 toxicity while increasing or maintaining its efficacy such that its effective doses can be tolerated in humans. This review highlights such developments and identifies promising future directions.">

Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative, harnessing the immune system to target cancer cells. However, the complexity of immune responses and tumor heterogeneity challenges its effectiveness. Objective: This mini-narrative review explores the role of artificial intelligence [AI] in enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, predicting patient responses, and discovering novel therapeutic targets. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies published between 2010 and 2024 that examined the application of AI in cancer immunotherapy. Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were utilized, and articles were selected based on relevance to the topic. Results: AI has significantly contributed to identifying biomarkers that predict immunotherapy efficacy by analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. It also optimizes combination therapies by predicting the most effective treatment protocols. AI-driven predictive models help assess patient response to immunotherapy, guiding clinical decision-making and minimizing side effects. Additionally, AI facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, such as neoantigens, enabling the development of personalized immunotherapies. Conclusions: AI holds immense potential in transforming cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges related to data privacy, algorithm transparency, and clinical integration must be addressed.

        <tr id="Abstract In recent years, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with antiangiogenic agents has led to significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Antiangiogenic therapy plays a pivotal role in normalizing blood vessels and remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment while ICIs not only enhance the host’s antitumor immune response by blocking negative regulatory signals but also promote vascular normalization. The communication between the vasculature and immune system enables the combined use of ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy to have a synergistic effect. Clinical research has also demonstrated that this combination therapy can significantly improve the efficacy and survival of patients with various solid tumors, the addition of pembrolizumab to axitinib can significantly improve PFS (15.4 m vs 11.1 m) compared to sunitinib in first-line treatments of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Bevacizumab is the first approved anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. Bevacizumab in combination with atezolizumab obtain significant benefit in terms of PFS (6.9 m vs 4.3 m) compared to sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, a series of investigations have been conducted in other solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Future research directions include the development of novel antiangiogenic agents and ICIs, the exploration of other combination strategies (eg, with chemotherapy or targeted therapy), and the identification of biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring response to therapy. Additionally, more studies are needed to understand the optimal timing and sequencing of these therapies to maximize patient benefit. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ICIs plus antiangiogenic drugs and provide summaries of related clinical trials. Meanwhile, we outline the current challenges faced and future directions, include the identification of biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring response to therapy, particularly highlighting the newer therapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Adoption of immunotherapy has completely transformed the treatment landscape of cancer. Patients with advanced cancer treated with immunotherapy may benefit from durable tumor response and long-term survival. The most widely used immunotherapy in solid tumors is anti-programmed-death (ligand) protein (PD-(L)1), which is now an integral part of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment irrespective of histological cell types and tumor stage. However, the vast majority of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 still develop therapeutic resistance, and the prognosis after anti-PD-(L)1 resistance is poor. Resistance mechanisms to PD-1 blockade are often complex and encompass a combination of defects within the cancer-immunity cycle. These defects include failure in antigen presentation and T-cell priming, presence of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints, inability of immune cells to infiltrate the tumor, and presence of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recently, advances in drug design, genomic sequencing, and gene editing technologies have led to development of next-generation immunotherapies that may potentially overcome these resistance mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the anti-PD-(L)1 resistance mechanism landscape in NSCLC and four novel modalities of immunotherapy in detail, namely novel immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy combinations, bispecific antibodies, cancer vaccine, and cell therapy. These novel therapeutics have all demonstrated early clinical data in NSCLC treatment and may work synergistically with each other to restore anticancer immunity. In addition, we share our perspectives on the future promises and challenges in the transformation of these novel immunotherapies to standard clinical care.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, the prognosis for patients with metastatic or advanced CRC remains poor. Immunotherapies comprising immune checkpoint inhibitors showed disappointing responses in metastatic CRC (mCRC). However, cellular immunotherapy, specifically using classical dendritic cells (cDCs), may hold unique promise in immune recognition for CRC antigens. cDCs are substantial players in immune recognition and are instrumental in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses by processing and presenting tumor antigens to effector cells. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are insufficiently studied but unique effector cells because of their ability to bridge innate and adaptive immune reactions and the crosstalk with dendritic cells in cancer. This review explores the therapeutic potential of using both cDCs and NKT cells as a synergistic therapy in CRC, focusing on their biological roles, strategies for harnessing their capabilities, clinical applications, and the challenges within the tumor microenvironment. Both cDCs and NKT cells can be used as a new effective approach for cell-based therapies in cancers to provide a new hope for CRC patients that are challenging to treat.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the proliferation of clonal plasma cells and associated with severe clinical manifestations. Despite advancements in diagnosis and management, Multiple Myeloma remains incurable, necessitating further research into more effective therapies. The primary objective of this review is to provide an informative and critical summary of the Multiple Myeloma microenvironment, and emerging revolutionary therapeutic approaches with potential combination therapy to improve the quality of life for Multiple Myeloma patients. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have shown improvements in immune response against Multiple Myeloma. ICIs target inhibitory pathways such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, potentially overcoming tumor-induced immunosuppression. Combination therapies integrate ICIs with proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has demonstrated effectiveness against Multiple Myeloma, particularly when coupled with ICIs to decrease resistance and relapse. Although the efficacy of ICIs in treating Multiple Myeloma has been hindered by the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion mechanisms, this challenge has led to the exploration of combination therapies. Potential side effects are still a big challenge for newly recognized ICIs and combination treatment. Investigations of new immune checkpoints and the development of targeted therapies against these markers are in progress, creating possibilities for more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Continuous research and robust clinical trials are needed to comprehend the complex dynamics of the Multiple Myeloma microenvironment to develop revolutionary therapeutic targets.">

 Lymph nodes (LNs) are critical components of the immune system, playing an essential role in the regulation of tumor immune surveillance and the progression of metastatic cancer. Recent advancements in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, have revolutionized cancer therapy by enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. However, the interaction between immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and lymphatic tissue, particularly the role of regional lymph nodes in treatment efficacy, remains insufficiently understood. This research explores the potential of combining immune checkpoint therapy with targeted strategies for managing nodal involvement in cancers. We aim to investigate the mechanisms by which tumor-infiltrating lymph nodes may either aid or hinder the response to ICBs, with a focus on the activation of anti-tumor immune responses within the nodal microenvironment. By examining how immune checkpoints impact tumor-associated lymphoid structures, we aim to identify strategies for improving regional lymph node management, including the use of neoadjuvant ICB, lymph node dissection, and lymph node-targeted drug delivery. The findings of this study may provide insights into optimizing immune checkpoint blockade therapies for cancers with extensive nodal metastasis and lead to novel therapeutic approaches that enhance regional immune responses while minimizing adverse effects. Ultimately, this research has the potential to contribute to a more personalized approach to cancer treatment, particularly for patients with advanced or metastatic disease, where nodal involvement is often a critical determinant of prognosis.

Its mortality rate accounts for 90% of all dermatologic tumor mortality. Traditional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are unable to achieve the expected results due to MM’s low sensitivity, high drug resistance, and toxic side effects. As treatment advances, immunotherapy and targeted therapy have made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of MM and have demonstrated promising application prospects. However, the heterogeneity of tumor immune response causes more than half of patients to not benefit from clinical immunotherapy and targeted therapy, which delays the patient’s condition and causes them to suffer adverse immune events’ side effects. The combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy can help improve therapeutic effects, delay drug resistance, and mitigate adverse effects.

        <tr id="Background Cancer immunotherapy is an advanced therapeutic approach that harnesses the body’s immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with a history rooted in centuries of clinical practice, plays a crucial role in enhancing immune responses, alleviating cancer-related symptoms, and reducing the risks of infections and complications in cancer patients. Methodology This review systematically examines the current literature on TCM-based formulations in cancer immunotherapy. It explores the mechanisms by which TCM augments immune responses, particularly focusing on how these formulations influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Various TCM herbs and compounds, their active ingredients, and their application in cancer prevention and treatment were analyzed through an integrated review of preclinical studies, clinical trials, and molecular mechanistic investigations. Results TCM formulations contribute to cancer therapy by modulating the body’s internal environment to improve immune defense. They enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and destroy cancer cells, promote apoptosis in tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and augment the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments. The review highlights specific TCM herbs and formulations that have demonstrated significant anti-cancer properties, including their ability to strengthen immune responses and provide synergistic effects with existing cancer therapies. Conclusion TCM-derived formulations represent a promising addition to cancer immunotherapy. The mechanisms through which these formulations enhance anti-tumor immunity are multifaceted, involving modulation of immune cell activity, apoptosis induction, and suppression of tumor progression. As cancer immunotherapy evolves, the integration of TCM into conventional treatment regimens may offer enhanced therapeutic efficacy, reduced side effects, and improved overall outcomes for cancer patients. Further clinical research is needed to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential and safety of TCM-based immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer care.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Numerous immunotherapy strategies have transformed hematological malignancies, including immune-checkpoint inhibitors for lymphomas, CAR-T cell therapies for B-cell cancers, and monoclonal antibodies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, similar advancements in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) remain challenging. Key barriers include the lack of universal, MPN-specific surface markers, high cellular and molecular variability among patients and MPN subtypes, and immune system disruptions caused by the neoplasm itself. Promising therapies in clinical trials include new JAK inhibitors with enhanced specificity for JAK2 and “add-on” drugs that boost ruxolitinib efficacy in both new and previously resistant patients. Additionally, novel therapeutic targets are under investigation. This review highlights current immunotherapy approaches in MPN treatment and emerging strategies poised to reshape clinical management in the near future.">

        <tr id="Tumour immunotherapy has made tremendous progress in the past decades, with numerous studies entering the clinical evaluation. The cancer vaccine is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in the immunotherapy of solid tumours. Cancer vaccines stimulate antitumor immunity using tumour antigens, which can be delivered as whole cells, peptides, nucleic acids, etc. An ideal cancer vaccine would be able to overcome tumour immunosuppression and induce both humoral and cellular immunity. The use of cancer vaccines is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in clinical oncology, which is achieved by stimulating anti-tumour immunity with tumour antigens delivered in the form of cells, peptides, viruses and nucleic acids. The ideal cancer vaccine has many advantages, including low toxicity, specificity, and induction of persistent immune memory to overcome tumour heterogeneity and reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Cancer treatment is done by surgery,chemotherapy,radiation therapy. These treatments may cure early-stage cancer, but are often ineffective in treating advanced or recurrent cancer. Basic and clinical studies of the tumour microenvironment, which consists of cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, have demonstrated the important role of antitumor immunity in cancer development and progression. Cancer immunotherapy has been proposed as a fourth cancer treatment option. In particular, the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, to various types of cancer represents a major advance in cancer treatment. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved to improve their clinical efficacy; these include low cancer cell antigenicity and poor infiltration and/or accumulation of immune cells in the cancer microenvironment.">

However, most patients with cancer do not benefit from the rapidly evolving improvements in the understanding of principal mechanisms determining cancer immune responsiveness (CIR); including patient-specific genetically determined and acquired factors, as well as intrinsic cancer cell biology. Though CIR is multifactorial, fundamental concepts are emerging that should be considered for the design of novel therapeutic strategies and related clinical studies. Recent advancements as well as novel approaches to address the limitations of current treatments are discussed here, with a specific focus on ICI and ACT.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapeutic vaccines are used to strengthen a patient’s own immune system by amplifying existing immune responses. Intralesional administration of the bacteria-based emm55 vaccine together with the PD1 checkpoint inhibitor produced a strong anti-tumor effect against the B16 melanoma murine model. However, it is not trivial to design an optimal order and frequency of injections for combination therapies. Here, we developed a coupled ordinary differential equations model calibrated to experimental data and used the mesh adaptive direct search method to optimize the treatment protocols of the emm55 vaccine and anti-PD1 combined therapy. This method determined that early consecutive vaccine injections combined with distributed anti-PD1 injections of decreasing separation time yielded the best tumor size reduction. The optimized protocols led to a twofold decrease in tumor area for the vaccine-alone treatment, and a fourfold decrease for the combined therapy. Our results reveal the tumor subpopulation dynamics in the optimal treatment condition, defining the path for efficacious treatment design. Similar computational frameworks can be applied to other tumors and other combination therapies to generate experimentally testable hypotheses in a fairly unrestricted and inexpensive setting.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, as critical components of the innate immune system, have emerged as promising candidates in cancer therapy due to their ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their mechanisms of action, including perforin-granzyme release and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), position them as versatile agents in cancer immunotherapy. Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity. This paper explores the therapeutic potential of NK cells, the challenges of immune resistance in the TME, and emerging strategies to enhance NK cell efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for optimizing NK cell-based treatments and achieving durable responses in cancer patients.">

Recent advances in immunology have revealed the potential of the immune system to fight cancer, leading to the emergence of immunotherapy. This review focuses on Natural Killer (NK) cells, innate immune effectors with a remarkable ability to directly kill cancer cells. We will explore the historical context of cancer treatment, the nature of NK cells, and the ways they have been developed to enhance their anti-tumor function, highlighting the limitations of conventional therapies. The therapeutic potential of NK cell-based immunotherapies will also be discussed, emphasizing their unique advantages over other immune cell-based approaches.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and treatment-resistant primary brain cancer. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated promising results in targeting these tumors, it has not yet been curative. An innovative approach to improve CAR T-cell efficacy is to combine them with other immune modulating therapies. In this study, we investigate in vitro combination of IL-13Rα2 targeted CAR T-cells with an oncolytic virus (OV) and study the complex interplay between tumor cells, CAR T-cells, and OV dynamics with a novel mathematical model. We fit the model to data collected from experiments with each therapy individually and in combination to reveal determinants of therapy synergy and improved efficacy. Our analysis reveals that the virus bursting size is a critical parameter in determining the net tumor infection rate and overall combination treatment efficacy. Moreover, the model predicts that administering the oncolytic virus simultaneously with, or prior to, CAR T-cells could maximize therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background More efficient therapeutic options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed as the survival at 5 years of metastatic disease is near zero. In this regard, we used a preclinical model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (SV2-OVA) to assess the safety and efficacy of novel radio-immunotherapy combining hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) with muPD1-IL2v immunocytokine and muFAP-CD40 bispecific antibody. Methods We evaluated the changes in the lung immune microenvironment at multiple timepoints following combination therapies and investigated their underlying antitumor mechanisms. Additionally, we analyzed the tumor clonal heterogeneity upon the combination treatments to explore potential mechanisms associated with the lack of complete response. Results The combination of HRT with muPD1-IL2v had a potent antitumor effect and increased survival in the SV2-OVA lung cancer model. Importantly, this combination therapy was devoid of measurable toxicity. It induced remodeling of the immune contexture through the increase of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells. The addition of muFAP-CD40 to the combination treatment further increased infiltrating CD8+ T cells, expressing high levels of effector molecules, both in the periphery and core tumor regions. An accumulation of CD8+ PD-1+ TOX+ (exhausted) T cells, already at the ‘early’ timepoint, is consistent with the limited clinical benefits provided by the various combination treatments in this model. The study of the clonal dynamics of tumor cells during disease progression and therapy highlighted a clonal selection upon HRT+muPD1-IL2v therapy. Conclusions We demonstrated that HRT+muPD1-IL2v combination is a potent therapeutic strategy to delay tumor growth and increase survival in a metastatic lung cancer model, but additional studies are required to completely understand the resistance mechanisms associated with the lack of complete response in this model.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor outcomes due to frequent recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. A major contributor to this resistance is the tumor’s ability to suppress natural killer (NK) cells, which are key players in the immune system’s fight against cancer. In PDAC, the tumor microenvironment (TME) creates conditions that impair NK cell function, including reduced proliferation, weakened cytotoxicity, and limited tumor infiltration. This review examines how interactions between tumor-derived factors, NK cells, and the TME contribute to tumor progression and treatment resistance. To address these challenges, we propose a new “Triple NK Cell Biomarker Approach”. This strategy focuses on identifying biomarkers from three critical areas: tumor characteristics, TME factors, and NK cell suppression mechanisms. This approach could guide personalized treatments to enhance NK cell activity. Additionally, we highlight the potential of combining NK cell-based therapies with conventional treatments and repurposed drugs to improve outcomes for PDAC patients. While progress has been made, more research is needed to better understand NK cell dysfunction and develop effective therapies to overcome these barriers.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, capitalizing on the unique ability of dendritic cells to initiate and regulate immune responses by presenting antigens to T-cells. These vaccines work by isolating dendritic cells from a patient, loading them with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and reinfusing them to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells. The FDA approval of sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for metastatic prostate cancer in 2010 marked a significant milestone in the field, demonstrating the potential for DC vaccines to prolong survival in cancer patients. This review explores the mechanism of action of dendritic cell vaccines, focusing on the process of antigen loading, dendritic cell maturation, and T-cell activation. It also discusses current clinical applications, challenges such as antigen selection, tumor immune evasion, and the high complexity of vaccine production. Future prospects for DC vaccines include personalized cancer vaccines, improved antigen delivery methods, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance effectiveness. Dendritic cell vaccines offer a novel and potentially durable approach to cancer treatment, but further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and broaden their application across various cancer types and other diseases.

        <tr id="Introduction The abscopal effect, a systemic anti-tumor response triggered by localized treatment, has gained attention but remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the efficacy and consistency of focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with immunotherapy in inducing the abscopal effect. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on preclinical studies using solid tumor models. Data on tumor response, immune modulation, and survival outcomes were analyzed to assess the combination therapy's effectiveness. Results FUS combined with immunotherapy enhanced anti-tumor responses at local and distant sites, with evidence of immune activation and increased abscopal effect rates. However, heterogeneity across tumor models and protocols was observed.

The most common treatment for PNET is surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Immunotherapy, especially ICIs, are hot topic in the oncology field in the recent years. However, researches found that the ICI therapies exhibit relatively lower significancy of patient outcomes for PNETs. Effects of long-term combination therapy still remains unanswered. This review analyzes the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and potential adverse events associated with ICIs in PNET treatment. It was found that personalized treatment strategies, particularly when combining ICIs with other therapeutic modalities, could improve patient responses while minimizing adverse effects. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for future studies, highlighting the necessity of similarly exploration into the molecular determinants of response to ICIs in PNETs. While this work lays the groundwork for enhancing remedy techniques, questions concerning long-term results and finest patient selection stay unresolved.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy is a cutting-edge approach that leverages sophisticated technology to target tumor-specific antibodies and modulate the immune system to eradicate cancer and enhance patients' quality of life. Bioinformatics and genetic science advancements have made it possible to diagnose and treat cancer patients using immunotherapy technology. However, current immunotherapies against cancer have limited clinical benefits due to cancer-associated antigens, which often fail to interact with immune cells and exhibit insufficient therapeutic targeting with unintended side effects. To surmount this challenge, nanoparticle systems have emerged as a potential strategy for transporting immunotherapeutic agents to cancer cells and activating immune cells to combat tumors. Consequently, this process potentially generates an antigen-specific T cells response that effectively suppresses cancer growth. Furthermore, nanoplatforms have high specificity, efficacy, diagnostic potential, and imaging capabilities, making them promising tools for cancer treatment. However, this informative paper delves into the various available immunotherapies, including CAR T cells therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, cytokines, cancer vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the paper delves into the concept of theragnostic nanotechnology, which integrates therapy and diagnostics for a more personalized treatment approach for cancer therapy.

        <tr id="Adoption of immunotherapy has completely transformed the treatment landscape of cancer. Patients with advanced cancer treated with immunotherapy may benefit from durable tumor response and long-term survival. The most widely used immunotherapy in solid tumors is anti-programmed-death (ligand) protein (PD-(L)1), which is now an integral part of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment irrespective of histological cell types and tumor stage. However, the vast majority of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 still develop therapeutic resistance, and the prognosis after anti-PD-(L)1 resistance is poor. Resistance mechanisms to PD-1 blockade are often complex and encompass a combination of defects within the cancer-immunity cycle. These defects include failure in antigen presentation and T-cell priming, presence of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints, inability of immune cells to infiltrate the tumor, and presence of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recently, advances in drug design, genomic sequencing, and gene editing technologies have led to development of next-generation immunotherapies that may potentially overcome these resistance mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the anti-PD-(L)1 resistance mechanism landscape in NSCLC and four novel modalities of immunotherapy in detail, namely novel immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy combinations, bispecific antibodies, cancer vaccine, and cell therapy. These novel therapeutics have all demonstrated early clinical data in NSCLC treatment and may work synergistically with each other to restore anticancer immunity. In addition, we share our perspectives on the future promises and challenges in the transformation of these novel immunotherapies to standard clinical care.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, the prognosis for patients with metastatic or advanced CRC remains poor. Immunotherapies comprising immune checkpoint inhibitors showed disappointing responses in metastatic CRC (mCRC). However, cellular immunotherapy, specifically using classical dendritic cells (cDCs), may hold unique promise in immune recognition for CRC antigens. cDCs are substantial players in immune recognition and are instrumental in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses by processing and presenting tumor antigens to effector cells. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are insufficiently studied but unique effector cells because of their ability to bridge innate and adaptive immune reactions and the crosstalk with dendritic cells in cancer. This review explores the therapeutic potential of using both cDCs and NKT cells as a synergistic therapy in CRC, focusing on their biological roles, strategies for harnessing their capabilities, clinical applications, and the challenges within the tumor microenvironment. Both cDCs and NKT cells can be used as a new effective approach for cell-based therapies in cancers to provide a new hope for CRC patients that are challenging to treat.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the proliferation of clonal plasma cells and associated with severe clinical manifestations. Despite advancements in diagnosis and management, Multiple Myeloma remains incurable, necessitating further research into more effective therapies. The primary objective of this review is to provide an informative and critical summary of the Multiple Myeloma microenvironment, and emerging revolutionary therapeutic approaches with potential combination therapy to improve the quality of life for Multiple Myeloma patients. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have shown improvements in immune response against Multiple Myeloma. ICIs target inhibitory pathways such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, potentially overcoming tumor-induced immunosuppression. Combination therapies integrate ICIs with proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has demonstrated effectiveness against Multiple Myeloma, particularly when coupled with ICIs to decrease resistance and relapse. Although the efficacy of ICIs in treating Multiple Myeloma has been hindered by the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion mechanisms, this challenge has led to the exploration of combination therapies. Potential side effects are still a big challenge for newly recognized ICIs and combination treatment. Investigations of new immune checkpoints and the development of targeted therapies against these markers are in progress, creating possibilities for more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Continuous research and robust clinical trials are needed to comprehend the complex dynamics of the Multiple Myeloma microenvironment to develop revolutionary therapeutic targets.">

 Radiation therapy (RT) can both stimulate antitumor immunity and induce immunosuppressive responses, complicating its therapeutic efficacy. Data indicate that certain patient subsets—such as those undergoing combination treatment with radiation and immune-oncology drugs and/or targeted therapies may benefit from strategies that target immunosuppression or metastasis-promoting factors. One of the key challenges is the heterogeneous and context-dependent nature of myeloid suppressive states in the tumor microenvironment, which often leads to resistance to RT and immunotherapy. RT has been shown to skew myeloid plasticity towards immune suppression by expanding myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations, increasing their trafficking into tumor tissues, and promoting the development of suppressive macrophage subsets. Targeting myeloid cell plasticity post-RT presents a promising therapeutic strategy. Interventions that block the systemic induction of immunosuppressive myeloid cells to inhibit their trafficking to tumors, or those that promote the conversion of suppressive myeloid cells into anti-tumor populations could enhance the effectiveness of RT. Additionally, radiation-induced proteins that can be inhibited or amplified may provide a potential avenue to overcome the limitations of RT alone, and in combination with immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Malignant melanoma (MM) is a malignant tumor, resulting from mutations in melanocytes of the skin and mucous membranes. Its mortality rate accounts for 90% of all dermatologic tumor mortality. Traditional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are unable to achieve the expected results due to MM’s low sensitivity, high drug resistance, and toxic side effects. As treatment advances, immunotherapy and targeted therapy have made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of MM and have demonstrated promising application prospects. However, the heterogeneity of tumor immune response causes more than half of patients to not benefit from clinical immunotherapy and targeted therapy, which delays the patient’s condition and causes them to suffer adverse immune events’ side effects. The combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy can help improve therapeutic effects, delay drug resistance, and mitigate adverse effects. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current development status and research progress of immune checkpoints, targeted genes, and their inhibitors, with a view to providing a reference for the clinical treatment of MM.">

Clinical trials involving PD-1 inhibition with nivolumab in combination with SOC failed to increase overall survival. A quantitative understanding of the interactions between the tumour and its immune environment driving treatment outcomes is currently lacking. As such, we developed a mathematical model of tumour growth that considers cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, pro- and antitumoral tumour-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs), SOC, and nivolumab. Our results show that PD-1 inhibition fails due to a lack of CD8+ T cell recruitment during treatment explained by TAM-driven immunosuppressive mechanisms. Using our model, we studied five TAM-targeting strategies currently under investigation for solid tumours. Our model predicts that while reducing TAM numbers does not improve prognosis, altering their functions to counter their protumoral properties has the potential to considerably reduce post-treatment tumour burden. In particular, restoring antitumoral TAM phagocytic activity through anti-CD47 treatment in combination with SOC was predicted to nearly eradicate the tumour. By studying time-varying efficacy with the same half-life as the anti-CD47 antibody Hu5F9-G4, our model predicts that repeated dosing of anti-CD47 provides sustained control of tumour growth. Thus, we propose that targeting TAMs by enhancing their antitumoral properties is a highly promising avenue to treat glioblastoma and warrants future clinical development. Together, our results provide proof-of-concept that mechanistic mathematical modelling can uncover the mechanisms driving treatment outcomes and explore the potential of novel treatment strategies for hard-to-treat tumours like glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer immunotherapy is an advanced therapeutic approach that harnesses the body’s immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with a history rooted in centuries of clinical practice, plays a crucial role in enhancing immune responses, alleviating cancer-related symptoms, and reducing the risks of infections and complications in cancer patients. Methodology This review systematically examines the current literature on TCM-based formulations in cancer immunotherapy. It explores the mechanisms by which TCM augments immune responses, particularly focusing on how these formulations influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Various TCM herbs and compounds, their active ingredients, and their application in cancer prevention and treatment were analyzed through an integrated review of preclinical studies, clinical trials, and molecular mechanistic investigations. Results TCM formulations contribute to cancer therapy by modulating the body’s internal environment to improve immune defense. They enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and destroy cancer cells, promote apoptosis in tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and augment the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments. The review highlights specific TCM herbs and formulations that have demonstrated significant anti-cancer properties, including their ability to strengthen immune responses and provide synergistic effects with existing cancer therapies. Conclusion TCM-derived formulations represent a promising addition to cancer immunotherapy. The mechanisms through which these formulations enhance anti-tumor immunity are multifaceted, involving modulation of immune cell activity, apoptosis induction, and suppression of tumor progression. As cancer immunotherapy evolves, the integration of TCM into conventional treatment regimens may offer enhanced therapeutic efficacy, reduced side effects, and improved overall outcomes for cancer patients. Further clinical research is needed to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential and safety of TCM-based immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer care.">

        <tr id="Tumour immunotherapy has made tremendous progress in the past decades, with numerous studies entering the clinical evaluation. The cancer vaccine is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in the immunotherapy of solid tumours. Cancer vaccines stimulate antitumor immunity using tumour antigens, which can be delivered as whole cells, peptides, nucleic acids, etc. An ideal cancer vaccine would be able to overcome tumour immunosuppression and induce both humoral and cellular immunity. The use of cancer vaccines is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in clinical oncology, which is achieved by stimulating anti-tumour immunity with tumour antigens delivered in the form of cells, peptides, viruses and nucleic acids. The ideal cancer vaccine has many advantages, including low toxicity, specificity, and induction of persistent immune memory to overcome tumour heterogeneity and reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Cancer treatment is done by surgery,chemotherapy,radiation therapy. These treatments may cure early-stage cancer, but are often ineffective in treating advanced or recurrent cancer. Basic and clinical studies of the tumour microenvironment, which consists of cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, have demonstrated the important role of antitumor immunity in cancer development and progression. Cancer immunotherapy has been proposed as a fourth cancer treatment option. In particular, the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, to various types of cancer represents a major advance in cancer treatment. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved to improve their clinical efficacy; these include low cancer cell antigenicity and poor infiltration and/or accumulation of immune cells in the cancer microenvironment.">

        <tr id="With few available treatments and a dismal prognosis, pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Immunotherapy has become a potential strategy to increase anti-tumor immunity, especially cancer vaccines. GVAX, an allogeneic pancreatic cancer vaccine employing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as an immune adjuvant, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Initial trials of GVAX showed mixed results, with some patients exhibiting immune responses and prolonged survival. Subsequent studies explored combinations with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab. While these combinations demonstrated promising immunological effects and improved clinical outcomes in some cases, the overall survival benefit has been inconsistent, especially in advanced disease stages. Recent trials are further investigating optimal combinations and dosing regimens to maximize the efficacy of GVAX-based immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, GVAX holds promise as a component of immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. However, further research is needed to optimize its use in combination with other therapies and to identify patient populations that may benefit most from this approach.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cancer immunotherapy—including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT)—has become a standard, potentially curative treatment for a subset of advanced solid and liquid tumors. However, most patients with cancer do not benefit from the rapidly evolving improvements in the understanding of principal mechanisms determining cancer immune responsiveness (CIR); including patient-specific genetically determined and acquired factors, as well as intrinsic cancer cell biology. Though CIR is multifactorial, fundamental concepts are emerging that should be considered for the design of novel therapeutic strategies and related clinical studies. Recent advancements as well as novel approaches to address the limitations of current treatments are discussed here, with a specific focus on ICI and ACT.">

        <tr id="Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a promising option for cancer treatment. OVT involves selective oncolytic virus (OV) replication within cancer cells, which triggers anti-tumor responses and immunostimulation. Despite promising potential, OVT faces critical challenges, including insufficient tumor-specific targeting, which results in limited tumor penetration and variability in therapeutic efficacy. These challenges are particularly pronounced in solid tumors with complex microenvironments and heterogeneous vascularization. A comprehensive research program is currently underway to develop and refine innovative delivery methods to address these issues to enhance OVT precision and efficacy. A principal area of investigation is the utilization of cellular carriers to enhance the delivery and distribution of OVs within tumor microenvironments, thereby optimizing immune system activation and maximizing anti-tumor effects. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the current strategies that are being used to enhance the delivery of OVs via cellular carriers with the goal of improving the clinical impact of OVT in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapeutic vaccines are used to strengthen a patient’s own immune system by amplifying existing immune responses. Intralesional administration of the bacteria-based emm55 vaccine together with the PD1 checkpoint inhibitor produced a strong anti-tumor effect against the B16 melanoma murine model. However, it is not trivial to design an optimal order and frequency of injections for combination therapies. Here, we developed a coupled ordinary differential equations model calibrated to experimental data and used the mesh adaptive direct search method to optimize the treatment protocols of the emm55 vaccine and anti-PD1 combined therapy. This method determined that early consecutive vaccine injections combined with distributed anti-PD1 injections of decreasing separation time yielded the best tumor size reduction. The optimized protocols led to a twofold decrease in tumor area for the vaccine-alone treatment, and a fourfold decrease for the combined therapy. Our results reveal the tumor subpopulation dynamics in the optimal treatment condition, defining the path for efficacious treatment design. Similar computational frameworks can be applied to other tumors and other combination therapies to generate experimentally testable hypotheses in a fairly unrestricted and inexpensive setting.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to combat cancer, marking a significant advancement in treatment. This review traces its evolution from the late 19th century to its current status. It began with William Coley’s pioneering work using bacterial toxins to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells, establishing the foundational concept of immunotherapy. In the mid-20th century, cytokine therapies like interferons and interleukins emerged, demonstrating that altering the immune response could reduce tumors and highlighting the complex interplay between cancer and the immune system. The discovery of immune checkpoints, regulatory pathways that prevent autoimmunity but are exploited by cancer cells to evade detection, was a pivotal development. Another major breakthrough is CAR-T cell therapy, which involves modifying a patient’s T cells to target cancer-specific antigens. This personalized treatment has shown remarkable success in certain blood cancers. Additionally, cancer vaccines aim to trigger immune responses against tumor-specific or associated antigens, and while challenging, ongoing research is improving their efficacy. The historical progression of cancer immunotherapy, from Coley’s toxins to modern innovations like checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, underscores its transformative impact on cancer treatment. As research delves deeper into the immune system’s complexities, immunotherapy is poised to become even more crucial in oncology, offering renewed hope to patients globally.">

        <tr id="The response rates to immunotherapy vary widely depending on the type of cancer and the specific treatment used and can be disappointingly low for many solid tumors. Fortunately, due to their complementary mechanisms of action, immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy have synergistic effects in cancer treatment. By normalizing the tumor vasculature, anti-angiogenic therapy can improve blood flow and oxygenation to facilitate better immune cell infiltration into the tumor and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. It also reduces immunosuppressive factors and enhances immune activation, to create a more favorable environment for immune cells to attack the tumor. Their combination leverages the strengths of both therapies to enhance anti-tumor effects and improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the vasculature-immunity crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment and summarizes the latest advances in combining anti-angiogenic therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat digestive system tumors.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with conventional treatments offering limited effectiveness in advanced stages, due to distant metastases and treatment resistance. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have shown promise, but their efficacy as standalone therapies are often insufficient. This has led to increased interest in combining ICIs with radiotherapy, known as radioimmunotherapy (iRT), to enhance treatment outcomes. This review explores the mechanisms that underlie the synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiotherapy can induce the “abscopal effect”, eliciting systemic immune responses that reduce tumor burdens outside the treated area. It also increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on tumor cells, improving immune recognition. Furthermore, radiotherapy can modify the tumor microenvironment by inducing metabolic reprogramming to bolster anti-tumor immunity. We discuss strategies for optimizing iRT, including considerations of radiation doses, fractionation schedules, and treatment site selection, which significantly influence immune responses by enhancing MHC-I expression or promoting T-cell infiltration. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of iRT in NSCLC and other cancers, though challenges in standardizing treatment protocols and managing side effects persist. Overall, radioimmunotherapy presents a promising approach to improving NSCLC treatment outcomes. Ongoing research into its mechanisms and the refinement of treatment may reshape clinical practice, offering more effective and personalized options for patients with advanced lung cancer. Further studies are essential to validate these findings and optimize therapeutic protocols.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, capitalizing on the unique ability of dendritic cells to initiate and regulate immune responses by presenting antigens to T-cells. These vaccines work by isolating dendritic cells from a patient, loading them with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and reinfusing them to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells. The FDA approval of sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for metastatic prostate cancer in 2010 marked a significant milestone in the field, demonstrating the potential for DC vaccines to prolong survival in cancer patients. This review explores the mechanism of action of dendritic cell vaccines, focusing on the process of antigen loading, dendritic cell maturation, and T-cell activation. It also discusses current clinical applications, challenges such as antigen selection, tumor immune evasion, and the high complexity of vaccine production. Future prospects for DC vaccines include personalized cancer vaccines, improved antigen delivery methods, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance effectiveness. Dendritic cell vaccines offer a novel and potentially durable approach to cancer treatment, but further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and broaden their application across various cancer types and other diseases.

        <tr id="Highlights What are the main findings? The article explores the use of autologous activated lymphocytes with their ability to elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses as a promising complex treatment strategy for lung cancer. The application of various types of T-cell therapy in complex lung cancer treatment in >2000 patients, with a special focus on the autologous activated lymphocytes and infusion protocols, was examined and thoroughly discussed. The article emphasizes the benefits of combining activated lymphocyte therapy with existing treatments like radiation therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, and chemotherapy to improve efficacy and reduce resistance. What are the implications of the main finding? Various cell types like natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes contribute to immune responses that assist in eliminating cancer cells. The potential research gaps are identified, and a wider adoption of immune cell therapy as a component of combination strategies for the treatment of lung cancer is proposed. The article highlights ongoing research into the tumor microenvironment and its role in immune evasion, suggesting that targeting these mechanisms could boost treatment success, and discusses the significance of clinical trials in validating the effectiveness of activated lymphocyte therapies and the importance of real-world evidence in guiding clinical practice. Abstract This review explores the significance and prospects of using diverse T-cell variants in the context of combined therapy for lung cancer treatment. Recently, there has been an increase in research focused on understanding the critical role of tumor-specific T lymphocytes and the potential benefits of autologous T-cell-based treatments for individuals with lung cancer. One promising approach involves intravenous administration of ex vivo-activated autologous lymphocytes to improve the immune status of patients with cancer. Investigations are also exploring the factors that influence the success of T-cell therapy and the methods used to stimulate them. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of activated lymphocytes and deciphering the mechanisms underlying their activation of innate anti-tumor immunity will pave the way for numerous clinical trials and the development of innovative strategies for cancer therapy like combined immunotherapy and radiation therapy.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy is a cutting-edge approach that leverages sophisticated technology to target tumor-specific antibodies and modulate the immune system to eradicate cancer and enhance patients' quality of life. Bioinformatics and genetic science advancements have made it possible to diagnose and treat cancer patients using immunotherapy technology. However, current immunotherapies against cancer have limited clinical benefits due to cancer-associated antigens, which often fail to interact with immune cells and exhibit insufficient therapeutic targeting with unintended side effects. To surmount this challenge, nanoparticle systems have emerged as a potential strategy for transporting immunotherapeutic agents to cancer cells and activating immune cells to combat tumors. Consequently, this process potentially generates an antigen-specific T cells response that effectively suppresses cancer growth. Furthermore, nanoplatforms have high specificity, efficacy, diagnostic potential, and imaging capabilities, making them promising tools for cancer treatment. However, this informative paper delves into the various available immunotherapies, including CAR T cells therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, cytokines, cancer vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the paper delves into the concept of theragnostic nanotechnology, which integrates therapy and diagnostics for a more personalized treatment approach for cancer therapy. Additionally, the paper covers the potential benefits of different nanocarrier systems, including marketed immunotherapy products, clinical trials, regulatory considerations, and future prospects for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor outcomes due to frequent recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. A major contributor to this resistance is the tumor’s ability to suppress natural killer (NK) cells, which are key players in the immune system’s fight against cancer. In PDAC, the tumor microenvironment (TME) creates conditions that impair NK cell function, including reduced proliferation, weakened cytotoxicity, and limited tumor infiltration. This review examines how interactions between tumor-derived factors, NK cells, and the TME contribute to tumor progression and treatment resistance. To address these challenges, we propose a new “Triple NK Cell Biomarker Approach”. This strategy focuses on identifying biomarkers from three critical areas: tumor characteristics, TME factors, and NK cell suppression mechanisms. This approach could guide personalized treatments to enhance NK cell activity. Additionally, we highlight the potential of combining NK cell-based therapies with conventional treatments and repurposed drugs to improve outcomes for PDAC patients. While progress has been made, more research is needed to better understand NK cell dysfunction and develop effective therapies to overcome these barriers.">

This study evaluates the efficacy and consistency of focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with immunotherapy in inducing the abscopal effect. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on preclinical studies using solid tumor models. Data on tumor response, immune modulation, and survival outcomes were analyzed to assess the combination therapy's effectiveness. Results FUS combined with immunotherapy enhanced anti-tumor responses at local and distant sites, with evidence of immune activation and increased abscopal effect rates. However, heterogeneity across tumor models and protocols was observed.

        <tr id="Effective cancer therapies must address the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex network of tumor cells and stromal components, including endothelial, immune, and mesenchymal cells. Durable outcomes require targeting both tumor cells and the TME while minimizing systemic toxicity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based therapies have shown efficacy in cancers such as metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but are limited by severe side effects. Innovative IL-2-based immunotherapeutic approaches include immunotoxins, such as antibody–drug conjugates, immunocytokines, and antibody–cytokine fusion proteins that enhance tumor-specific delivery. These strategies activate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, eliciting a potent Th1-mediated anti-tumor response. Modified IL-2 variants with reduced Treg cell activity further improve specificity and reduce immunosuppression. Additionally, IL-2 conjugates with peptides or anti-angiogenic agents offer improved therapeutic profiles. Combining IL-2-based therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), anti-angiogenic agents, or radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies highlight reduced toxicity and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, overcoming TME-driven immune suppression. These approaches mitigate the limitations of high-dose soluble IL-2 therapy, promoting immune activation and minimizing adverse effects. This review critically explores advances in IL-2-based therapies, focusing on immunotoxins, immunocytokines, and IL-2 derivatives. Emphasis is placed on their role in combination strategies, showcasing their potential to target the TME and improve clinical outcomes effectively. Also, the use of IL-2 immunocytokines in “in situ” vaccination to relieve the immunosuppression of the TME is discussed.">

        <tr id="Adoption of immunotherapy has completely transformed the treatment landscape of cancer. Patients with advanced cancer treated with immunotherapy may benefit from durable tumor response and long-term survival. The most widely used immunotherapy in solid tumors is anti-programmed-death (ligand) protein (PD-(L)1), which is now an integral part of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment irrespective of histological cell types and tumor stage. However, the vast majority of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 still develop therapeutic resistance, and the prognosis after anti-PD-(L)1 resistance is poor. Resistance mechanisms to PD-1 blockade are often complex and encompass a combination of defects within the cancer-immunity cycle. These defects include failure in antigen presentation and T-cell priming, presence of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints, inability of immune cells to infiltrate the tumor, and presence of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recently, advances in drug design, genomic sequencing, and gene editing technologies have led to development of next-generation immunotherapies that may potentially overcome these resistance mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the anti-PD-(L)1 resistance mechanism landscape in NSCLC and four novel modalities of immunotherapy in detail, namely novel immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy combinations, bispecific antibodies, cancer vaccine, and cell therapy. These novel therapeutics have all demonstrated early clinical data in NSCLC treatment and may work synergistically with each other to restore anticancer immunity. In addition, we share our perspectives on the future promises and challenges in the transformation of these novel immunotherapies to standard clinical care.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: It remains challenging to treat recurrent ovarian cancer effectively as traditional interventions like chemotherapy and surgery have limited long-term efficacy, highlighting an urgent need for innovative approaches. Immunotherapy offers potential advantages in modulating the immune response against tumor cells and has emerged as a promising strategy in ovarian cancer management. This review discusses various immunotherapy modalities, including active and passive immune strategies, for recurrent ovarian cancer. Methods: We systematically reviewed recent immunotherapy advances for recurrent ovarian cancer, including the efficacy and mechanisms of single and dual immune checkpoint inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitor combinations with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, PARP inhibitors, antibody–drug conjugates (ADC), tumor vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies (ACT). Additionally, we assessed emerging research on biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy responsiveness in ovarian cancer. Results: The findings indicate that immunotherapy, particularly combinations involving immune checkpoint inhibitors and other agents, demonstrates promising efficacy in recurrent ovarian cancer, with some therapies showing enhanced benefits in specific subtypes. The immune microenvironment in platinum-sensitive and -resistant cases exhibits distinct immunological profiles, influencing therapy outcomes. Several potential biomarkers have been identified, potentially aiding in patient stratification and treatment optimization. Conclusions: Immunotherapy significantly advances recurrent ovarian cancer treatment, with various combinations potentially improving outcomes. Further research on predictive biomarkers and immune microenvironment characteristics is crucial for personalizing immunotherapy approaches and enhancing their efficacy in managing recurrent ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy describes a class of therapies in which the immune system is manipulated for therapeutic benefit. These treatments include immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, and vaccines. For many hematological malignancies, immunotherapy has emerged as an essential treatment component. However, this success has yet to be replicated for solid tumors, which develop advanced physical and molecular mechanisms for suppressing and evading immune destruction. Nevertheless, cytokine immunotherapy presents a potential remedy to these barriers by delivering a proinflammatory immune signal to the tumor and thereby transforming it from immunologically “cold” to “hot.” Interleukin‐12 (IL‐12), one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines, was initially investigated for this purpose. However, initial murine and human studies in which IL‐12 was administered systemically resulted in dangerous immunotoxicity associated with off‐target immune activation. As a result, recent studies have employed advanced cell and molecular engineering approaches to reduce IL‐12 toxicity while increasing or maintaining its efficacy such that its effective doses can be tolerated in humans. This review highlights such developments and identifies promising future directions.">

        <tr id="Abstract In recent years, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with antiangiogenic agents has led to significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Antiangiogenic therapy plays a pivotal role in normalizing blood vessels and remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment while ICIs not only enhance the host’s antitumor immune response by blocking negative regulatory signals but also promote vascular normalization. The communication between the vasculature and immune system enables the combined use of ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy to have a synergistic effect. Clinical research has also demonstrated that this combination therapy can significantly improve the efficacy and survival of patients with various solid tumors, the addition of pembrolizumab to axitinib can significantly improve PFS (15.4 m vs 11.1 m) compared to sunitinib in first-line treatments of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Bevacizumab is the first approved anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. Bevacizumab in combination with atezolizumab obtain significant benefit in terms of PFS (6.9 m vs 4.3 m) compared to sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, a series of investigations have been conducted in other solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Future research directions include the development of novel antiangiogenic agents and ICIs, the exploration of other combination strategies (eg, with chemotherapy or targeted therapy), and the identification of biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring response to therapy. Additionally, more studies are needed to understand the optimal timing and sequencing of these therapies to maximize patient benefit. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ICIs plus antiangiogenic drugs and provide summaries of related clinical trials. Meanwhile, we outline the current challenges faced and future directions, include the identification of biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring response to therapy, particularly highlighting the newer therapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Tumour immunotherapy has made tremendous progress in the past decades, with numerous studies entering the clinical evaluation. The cancer vaccine is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in the immunotherapy of solid tumours. Cancer vaccines stimulate antitumor immunity using tumour antigens, which can be delivered as whole cells, peptides, nucleic acids, etc. An ideal cancer vaccine would be able to overcome tumour immunosuppression and induce both humoral and cellular immunity. The use of cancer vaccines is considered a promising therapeutic strategy in clinical oncology, which is achieved by stimulating anti-tumour immunity with tumour antigens delivered in the form of cells, peptides, viruses and nucleic acids. The ideal cancer vaccine has many advantages, including low toxicity, specificity, and induction of persistent immune memory to overcome tumour heterogeneity and reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Cancer treatment is done by surgery,chemotherapy,radiation therapy. These treatments may cure early-stage cancer, but are often ineffective in treating advanced or recurrent cancer. Basic and clinical studies of the tumour microenvironment, which consists of cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, have demonstrated the important role of antitumor immunity in cancer development and progression. Cancer immunotherapy has been proposed as a fourth cancer treatment option. In particular, the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, to various types of cancer represents a major advance in cancer treatment. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved to improve their clinical efficacy; these include low cancer cell antigenicity and poor infiltration and/or accumulation of immune cells in the cancer microenvironment.">

Through a comprehensive literature review, we propose a novel CD300ld antigen-specific liposome cargo delivery system for targeting MDSC mediated immune-suppression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Hypothetically, this approach could exhibit enhanced immune engagement and significant anti-tumor effects through the artificial expression of CD47 inhibitor and suppression of STAT3-dependent immunosuppressive cytokines. Further validation in primate models, combined with conventional immune check-point inhibitor (ICI) treatments, could be conducted for a more comprehensive understanding of this model.">

        <tr id="Bone metastases are a prevalent complication in advanced cancers, particularly in breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and are associated with severe skeletal-related events (SREs), including fractures, spinal cord compression, and debilitating pain. Conventional bone-targeted treatments like bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibitors (denosumab) reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption but do not directly impact tumor progression within the bone. This review focuses on examining the growing potential of immunotherapy in targeting the unique challenges posed by bone metastases. Even though immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly changed cancer treatment, their impact on bone metastases appears limited because of the bone microenvironment’s immunosuppressive traits, which include high levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) and the immune-suppressing cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This review underscores the investigation of combined therapeutic approaches that might ease these difficulties, such as the synergy of immune checkpoint inhibitors with agents aimed at bones (denosumab, bisphosphonates), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, as well as the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with different immunotherapeutic methods, including CAR T-cell therapy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of preclinical studies and clinical trials that show the synergistic potential of these combination approaches, which aim to both enhance immune responses and mitigate bone destruction. By offering an in-depth exploration of how these strategies can be tailored to the bone microenvironment, this review underscores the need for personalized treatment approaches. The findings emphasize the urgent need for further research into overcoming immune evasion in bone metastases, with the goal of improving patient survival and quality of life.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology by harnessing the body’s immune system to target and eradicate malignant cells. This review delves into emerging strategies in cancer immunotherapy, focusing on novel approaches and future directions of this rapidly evolving field. Key areas of exploration include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, and cancer vaccines. ICIs, which target proteins such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand 1, have shown significant efficacy in various cancers, transforming clinical outcomes. CAR-T cell therapy, with its ability to genetically modify T-cells to attack cancer cells, has demonstrated remarkable success in hematologic malignancies and is being adapted for solid tumors. Cancer vaccines designed to stimulate an immune response against specific tumor antigens are also advancing with promising clinical results. Despite these advances, challenges such as immunogenicity, side effects, and treatment resistance remain. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments, clinical trials, and future perspectives in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting the potential for these strategies to redefine cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer has emerged as one of the predominant malignant tumors globally. Immunotherapy, as a novel therapeutic methodology, has opened up new possibilities for colorectal cancer patients. However, its actual clinical efficacy requires further enhancement. Copper, as an exceptionally crucial trace element, can influence various signaling pathways, gene expression, and biological metabolic processes in cells, thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have revealed that cuproptosis, a novel mode of cell death, holds promise to become a potential target to overcome resistance to colorectal cancer immunotherapy. This shows substantial potential in the combination treatment of colorectal cancer. Conveying copper into tumor cells via a nano-drug delivery system to induce cuproptosis of colorectal cancer cells could offer a potential strategy for eliminating drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and vastly improving the efficacy of immunotherapy while ultimately destroy colorectal tumors. Moreover, combining the cuproptosis induction strategy with other anti-tumor approaches such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy could further enhance its therapeutic effect. This review aims to illuminate the practical significance of cuproptosis and cuproptosis-inducing nano-drugs in colorectal cancer immunotherapy, and scrutinize the current challenges and limitations of this methodology, thereby providing innovative thoughts and references for the advancement of cuproptosis-based colorectal cancer immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer presenting a substantial treatment challenge. The authors focuse on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radiotheranostics, particularly lutetium 177 (177Lu)-PSMA radioligand therapy, as an emerging treatment modality for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of 177Lu-PSMA-617 marked a substantial advancement in the treatment paradigm of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on the VISION trial that showed improved overall survival and quality of life compared with those for standard care. PSMA expression, assessed via PSMA PET, is crucial for patient selection and assessment of treatment eligibility. The authors discuss current practices, including therapy administration, dosing, and side effects, with a particular focus on eligibility criteria and the added value of posttherapy imaging. Response assessment criteria using PSMA PET are discussed, although these require further validation. The discussion of future directions highlights ongoing trials investigating PSMA targeting agents, the extension of radioligand therapy to earlier stages of prostate cancer, and combination therapies. This review underscores the role of PSMA radioligand therapy in the evolving landscape of prostate cancer treatment and its promise for improving patient outcomes. ©RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.">

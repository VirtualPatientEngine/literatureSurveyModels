        <tr id="General and simple principles are identified that govern signal transduction. The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude, duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal −1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF‐induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration. Implications for the cellular decision between growth and differentiation are discussed.">

        <tr id="The Notch, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, and EGF pathways have long been known to influence cell fate specification in the developing nervous system. Here we attempted to evaluate the contemporary knowledge about neural stem cell differentiation promoted by various drug-based regulations through a systems biology approach. Our model showed the phenomenon of DAPT-mediated antagonism of Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes and enhancement of Shh target genes by a SAG agonist that were effectively demonstrated computationally and were consistent with experimental studies. However, in the case of model simulation of Wnt and EGF pathways, the model network did not supply any concurrent results with experimental data despite the fact that drugs were added at the appropriate positions. This paves insight into the potential of crosstalks between pathways considered in our study. Therefore, we manually developed a map of signaling crosstalk, which included the species connected by representatives from Notch, Shh, Wnt, and EGF pathways and highlighted the regulation of a single target gene, Hes-1, based on drug-induced simulations. These simulations provided results that matched with experimental studies. Therefore, these signaling crosstalk models complement as a tool toward the discovery of novel regulatory processes involved in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation during mammalian central nervous system development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a simple crosstalk map that highlights the differential regulation of neural stem cell differentiation and underscores the flow of positive and negative regulatory signals modulated by drugs.">

        <tr id="Relapse and metastasis are the major challenges that stand in the way of cancer healing and survival, mainly attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Their capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenic potential leads to treatment resistance development. CSCs function through signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. While commonly involved in embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis, the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway has direct correlations with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The development of therapies that target CSCs and bulk tumors is both crucial and urgent. However, the extensive crosstalk present between Wnt and other signaling networks (Hedgehog and Notch) complicates the development of efficient long-term therapies with minimal side-effects on normal tissues. Despite the obstacles, the emergence of Wnt inhibitors and subsequent modulation of the signaling pathways would provide dynamic therapeutic approaches to impairing CSCs and reversing resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The Wnt signaling pathway is critical in the onset and progression of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Anomalies in this pathway, often stemming from mutations in critical components such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or β-catenin, lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. In the case of colorectal cancer, dysregulation of the Wnt pathway drives tumor initiation and growth. Similarly, aberrant Wnt signaling contributes to tumor development, metastasis, and resistance to therapy in other GI cancers, such as gastric, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Targeting the Wnt pathway or its downstream effectors has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for combating these highly aggressive GI malignancies. Here, we review the dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and further explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the various components of the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, we summarize and integrate the preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy of potent Wnt pathway inhibitors with completed and ongoing clinical trials in GI cancers. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of Wnt pathway-targeted therapies in GI cancers to overcome these concerns for effective clinical translation.">

        <tr id="The complex signaling network within the breast tumor microenvironment is crucial for its growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, therapy escape, stem cell maintenance, and immunomodulation. An array of secretory factors and their receptors activate downstream signaling cascades regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis. Among various signaling pathways, the EGFR, ER, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have recently been identified as crucial in terms of breast cancer proliferation, survival, differentiation, maintenance of CSCs, and therapy failure. These receptors mediate various downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK, including MEK/ERK signaling pathways that promote common pro-oncogenic signaling, whereas dysregulation of PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT activates key oncogenic events such as drug resistance, CSC enrichment, and metabolic reprogramming. Additionally, these cascades orchestrate an intricate interplay between stromal cells, immune cells, and tumor cells. Metabolic reprogramming and adaptations contribute to aggressive breast cancer and are unresponsive to therapy. Herein, recent insights into the novel signaling pathways operating within the breast TME that aid in their advancement are emphasized and current developments in practices targeting the breast TME to enhance treatment efficacy are reviewed.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in the medical field in this century, largely due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. Fortunately, recent advancements in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis have helped identify more therapeutic targets for improved treatment outcomes. The WNT signaling pathways are highly conserved cascades that participate in diverse physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. Ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, is driven by lipid peroxidation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Emerging evidence shows that the dysregulation of WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis, as well as their intricate crosstalk, plays crucial roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, indicating their potential as targets for cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the crosstalk between WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer, with a specific focus on the regulatory role of the canonical WNT cascade in cancer-related ferroptosis. In addition, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms of current strategies that inhibit canonical WNT signaling and/or induce ferroptosis in cancer treatment. We propose that combining canonical WNT pathway inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers and current therapies represents a promising therapeutic strategy for personalized cancer treatment.">

Dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways leads to changes in proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis, leading to cancer. This review aims to provide insight into the major three signaling
pathways implicated in cancer development and progression: the Hedgehog (Hh), Phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and Notch pathways. Abnormal activation of the Hedgehog pathway,
which has been linked to several malignancies, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma,
is primarily responsible for controlling the phases of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
The intricate involvement of Hh signaling in cancer stem cell maintenance, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, and tumor microenvironment modulation underscores its significance as a therapeutic
target. Similarly, dysregulation of the PI3K pathway, a crucial mediator of cell growth, survival, and
metabolism, is prevalent across multiple cancer types. Mutations in PI3K pathway components lead
to uncontrolled cell proliferation and evasion of apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic
avenue. Various inhibitors targeting PI3K and its downstream effectors have shown promise in preclinical
and clinical settings. Additionally, the Notch signaling pathway, crucial for cell fate determination
and tissue patterning during development, exhibits dysregulated activity in numerous cancers.
Notch pathway alterations contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, presenting
opportunities for targeted therapies. The review discusses current therapeutic strategies targeting
these pathways, including small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and combination therapies.
Challenges, such as drug resistance and toxicity are addressed, along with emerging therapeutic
approaches to enhance treatment efficacy. In conclusion, understanding the intricate crosstalk and
dysregulation of signaling pathways in cancer provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms
and therapeutic avenues, paving the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterized by significant morbidity and mortality rates, poses a substantial threat to human health. The expression of ligands and receptors within the classical and non-classical Wnt signaling pathways plays an important role in HCC. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for regulating multiple biological processes in HCC, including proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor microenvironment modulation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell characteristics, and autophagy. Molecular agents that specifically target the Wnt signaling pathway have demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of HCC. However, the precise mechanism by which the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with HCC remains unclear. In this paper, we review the alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC, the mechanism of Wnt pathway action in HCC, and molecular agents targeting the Wnt pathway. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for identifying molecular agents targeting the Wnt pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.">

        <tr id="Wnt (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) signaling is an evolutionary conserved system highly active during embryogenesis, but in adult hearts has low activities under normal conditions. It is essential for a variety of physiological processes including stem cell regeneration, proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and morphogenesis, thereby ensuring homeostasis and regeneration of cardiac tissue. Its dysregulation and excessive activation during pathological conditions leads to morphological and functional changes in the heart resulting in impaired myocardial regeneration under pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Several groups of Wnt inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to modulate the Wnt pathway and thereby significantly reduce fibrosis and improve cardiac function after myocardial ischemia. Their inhibitory effect can be realized at multiple levels, which include the inhibition of Wnt ligands, the inhibition of Frizzled receptors, the stabilization of the β-catenin destruction complex, and the disruption of nuclear β-catenin interactions. In this review, we overview the function of Wnt signaling in responses of cardiac cells to pathological conditions, especially ischemic heart disease, with an emphasis on the use of inhibitors of this signaling as a therapeutic approach. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge about the potential of the targeting of Wnt signaling in therapeutic applications.">

This review systematically explores the critical roles of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma (GBM), especially through the regulation of Notch, Wnt, and Hh signaling pathways. The maintenance of CSC properties is primarily dependent on the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways. This review explores the mechanisms of these pathways in GBM, discusses multi-targeted combination therapies, and highlights emerging strategies and drugs for targeted therapy. The results indicate that targeting Notch, Wnt, and Hh pathways can effectively suppress CSC proliferation and invasiveness in GBM, significantly delaying tumor recurrence. Future research should further explore the clinical potential of these pathway inhibitors and develop more specific targeted therapies to improve GBM treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.">

        <tr id="Cancer sparks if the components of the cellular signaling network are aberrantly activated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. One of the most important players of this highly regulated network is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with a significant role in human health and disease. The critical co-receptor of this pathway, LRP6, is overexpressed in various cancer types and is a target for therapy. Therefore, understanding the details of the LRP6 structural activation mechanism is of tremendous importance. This research intended to compare the structural-dynamics features of the E3E4 functional domain of LRP6 induced by the activator Wnt3a and the inhibitor, Dkk1_C, compared with the receptor behavior in the apo-state. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and G_MMPBSA calculation, we characterized overlapping binding regions of Wnt3a and Dkk1_C on E3E4. Despite their overall similar interacting regions, Dkk1_C and Wnt induce remarkably different inter-blades hydrogen bonds, structural-dynamics behavior, and conformational energy landscape in E3E4. According to our findings, Dkk1_C stabilized the interaction. between BP3 blades 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 and BP4 blades 1-6, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4, aligned with apo-state. However, on the other hand, Wnt distinguishably destabilized the hydrogen bond networks of these blades. Our DCCM analysis also depicted a similar correlation pattern of apo and Dkk1-bound states, and dramatic differences in Wnt-bound state, with a specific enhancement of correlated movements in EGF4. These data provide atomistic-level clues of how natural regulators of Wnt signaling manipulate LRP6 dynamics and, therefore, guide the structure-based design of efficient artificial inhibitors/activators for the pathway.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is infamous for its aggressive phenotype and poorer prognosis when compared to other breast cancer subtypes. One factor contributing to this poor prognosis is that TNBC lacks expression of the receptors that available hormonal or molecular-oriented therapies attack. New treatments that exploit biological targets specific to TNBC are desperately needed to improve patient outcomes. One promising target for therapeutic manipulation is the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with many invasive breast cancers, including TNBC. This pathway is activated in TNBC cells when extracellular Wnt ligands bind to overexpressed Frizzled7 (FZD7) transmembrane receptors, leading to downstream activation of intracellular β-catenin proteins. To target and inhibit Wnt signaling in TNBC cells, polymer nanoparticles (NPs) modified with anti-FZD7 antibodies and β-catenin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were developed, and their impact on the oncogenic behavior of treated TNBC cells was investigated. When compared to control NPs, the Wnt-targeted NPs induced greater levels of Wnt oncogene suppression. This led to greater inhibition of oncogenic and stem-like properties, including cell proliferation, drug resistance, and spheroid formation capacity. This work demonstrates a promising approach for targeting the Wnt pathway in TNBC to counter the cellular phenotypes that drive disease progression.">

In granulosa cells (GCs), these pathways are activated by FSH and IGF1 through respective receptors. We investigated the comparative transcriptome changes induced by AKT and ERK pathways using corresponding inhibitors in GCs. GCs isolated from antral follicles showed positive signals for phospho-AKT and -ERK proteins. Treatment of cultured GCs with FSH and IGF1 induced phospho-AKT and -ERK levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1436 genes regulated by AKT and 654 genes regulated by ERK pathway. Among these, 94 genes were commonly downregulated, and 11 genes were commonly upregulated in both data sets, while 110 genes were oppositely regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways downregulates key reproductive processes and upstream molecules. Notably, AKT inhibition affected FSH, ESRRG, and HIF1 pathways, while ERK inhibition impacted CG, FOS, TGFβ, EGR1, and LH pathways. Transcriptome data showed that genes related to estradiol production were inhibited by ERK and induced by the AKT pathway. This was verified by radioimmunoassays, and mRNA and protein analysis of CYP19A1 and STAR genes. In addition, transcriptome data suggested downregulation of glucose metabolism in GCs. Using validation experiments, we confirm that both pathways are essential for glucose uptake, lactate production, and mitochondrial activity in GCs. These data provide a resource for informing future research for analyzing various novel candidate genes regulated by AKT and ERK pathways in GCs and other cell types.">

Recent studies have placed a growing emphasis on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the context of understanding epidermal stem cells, uncovering its significant role in determining their fate. The activation of GPCR triggers the subsequent dissociation of the βγ subunits from the α subunit of G protein, leading to the modulation of various downstream signaling pathways, such as the WNT-BMP signaling crosstalk and the Gαs-PKA signaling pathway. These pathways collectively influence the fate of epidermal stem cells. Consequently, targeted GPCR therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for improving skin health by orchestrating the fate of epidermal stem cells, unveiling potential therapeutic targets that demand further investigation.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of the Wnt1/β-catenin signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be a driving factor in the propagation of several human cancers. Previous studies have discovered methyl 3-{[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amino}benzoate (MSAB) as a selective inhibitor of the Wnt1/β-catenin signaling pathway, which putatively functions through direct engagement of β-catenin. To understand how changes to the identity and position of the methyl ester affect the in vitro potency of this compound in Wnt1-driven mammalian cell lines, we prepared and evaluated three analogs of MSAB with 3- and 4-substituted methyl and ethyl esters. In MTT assays, analogs with methyl esters showed significantly more activity than their ethyl ester counterparts and both 4-substituted esters exhibited significantly attenuated antiproliferative activity, with MSAB exhibiting dose-dependent activity across cancerous cell lines. Further analysis by flow cytometry reveals low-Annexin V signal, suggesting that these compounds do not function via a pro-apoptotic pathway. Additionally, through a TCF/LEF-activated luciferase reporter cell assay, we observe that the 4-substituted methyl ester analogous to MSAB exhibits slightly diminished Wnt1-inhibitory activity, while 3- and 4-substituted ethyl esters exhibit minimal Wnt1-inhibitory activity. This difference in potency with a simple ester substitution might be attributed to several factors that ultimately drive antiproliferative activity, prompting the investigation of other potential substituents to further investigate the structure-activity relationship of these compounds as Wnt1-based antiproliferative agents.">

        <tr id="The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade, coordinates with many intracellular signals and mediates the regulation of the activities of various downstream transcription factors and their coactivators to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, the aberrant activation of the Hippo pathway and its associated molecules imposes significant stress on tissues and cells, leading to cancer, immune disorders, and a number of diseases. Cellular senescence, the mechanism by which cells counteract stress, prevents cells from unnecessary damage and leads to sustained cell cycle arrest. It acts as a powerful defense mechanism against normal organ development and aging-related diseases. On the other hand, the accumulation of senescent cells without their proper removal contributes to the development or worsening of cancer and age-related diseases. A correlation was recently reported between the Hippo pathway and cellular senescence, which preserves tissue homeostasis. This review is the first to describe the close relationship between aging and the Hippo pathway, and provides insights into the mechanisms of aging and the development of age-related diseases. In addition, it describes advanced findings that may lead to the development of tissue regeneration therapies and drugs targeting rejuvenation.">

        <tr id="Cell states evolve through the combined activity of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. While transcription factors can direct cell fate, these factors rely on a cell state that is receptive to transitions in cell identity. How signaling levels contribute to the emergence of receptive cell states remains poorly defined in primary cells. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, we examined how levels of the MAPK-activating oncogene HRASG12V influence direct conversion of primary fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. We demonstrate that an optimal ‘Goldilocks’ level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Rates of direct conversion respond biphasically to increasing HRASG12V levels. While intermediate HRASG12V levels increase the rate of conversion, high levels of HRASG12V induce senescence. Through chemogenetic tuning, we set optimal MAPK activity for high rates of conversion in the absence of HRAS mutants. As MAPK pathways influence cell-fate transitions in development and disease, our results highlight the need to tune therapeutic interventions within a non-monotonic landscape that is shaped by genetics and levels of gene expression.

This study focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of the MAPK signaling pathway and the role of MAPK phosphatase (MKP) in regulating its activity. The goal of this study is to elucidate the specific function of MKP in the regulation of MAPK signaling and to identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with MAPK dysregulation. In this study, the interaction between MKP and MAPK signaling was investigated using cellular models and biochemical experiments. The primary targets were cells expressing MAPK and MKP, and protein-protein interactions and signaling dynamics were analyzed using methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. According to this study, MKP is crucial for the exact temporal and spatial modulation of MAPK signaling through its negative regulation. An imbalance in this balance can lead to pathological conditions. This study highlights the importance of MKP in cellular homeostasis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent.">

We discuss whether EMT and cancer stem cells (CSCs) function in conjunction, independently, or if a link is connecting their development. We further propose that this pathway is necessary to establish a connection between these two phenotypes.

Functional enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the biological pathways associated with VANGL2 in glioma. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the impact of VANGL2 on glioma cell behaviors. Furthermore, rigorous methodologies were employed in survival analysis to control for confounding factors.We identified substantial upregulation of VANGL2 gene in both low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM). Functional enrichment analysis of genes positively associated with VANGL2 in glioma underscored their enrichment in Notch signaling and pathway regulating pluripotency of stem cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that VANGL2 promotes glioma cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and tumor sphere formation. We identified a significant correlation between increased VANGL2 expression and IDH mutation in glioma patients.

TMEM196 is expressed in the floor plate, and its overexpression leads to reduced cell proliferation without affecting the pattern formation of the neural tube. We also established the floor plate differentiation protocol of the mouse embryonic stem cells, and analyzed the function of TMEM196 with this system. Mutating the Tmem196 gene does not alter cell division and overall differentiation remains unchanged within the neural cells. However, TMEM196 inhibits Wnt signaling, and Tmem196 mutant cells exhibit aberrant paraxial mesoderm differentiation, suggesting that TMEM196 selects the floor plate cell fate at the binary decision of the neuromesodermal cells. These findings highlight TMEM196 as a key regulator of both cell proliferation and floor plate determination, contributing to proper regionalization during embryogenesis.">

        <tr id="Background: The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway is central to various biological processes, including tissue regeneration, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in cancer progression and poor prognosis. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, the complexity of HGF/c-Met signaling and the associated challenges, such as off-target effects and limited understanding of its role in different disease contexts, pose significant obstacles to clinical translation.
Objectives: This review aims to examine the role of the HGF/c-Met pathway in tissue regeneration and cancer, with a focus on its therapeutic potential. We explore how HGF/c-Met signaling contributes to stem cell function, tissue repair, and cancer biology, as well as the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating this pathway.
Methods: A thorough review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies examining HGF/c-Met signaling in cancer and tissue regeneration. Relevant research databases were explored to identify key findings related to HGF/c-Met interactions, the effects of HGF on stem cell function, and the development of therapeutic agents targeting this pathway.
Conclusions: The HGF/c-Met pathway holds significant promise in both cancer treatment and tissue regeneration, particularly through its role in stem cell biology. Further research is needed to better understand its mechanisms and optimize targeted therapies. Combining pharmacological agents that modulate HGF/c-Met signaling with personalized treatment approaches could enhance therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients. Addressing current limitations, including the refinement of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, will be essential in fully harnessing the potential of HGF/c-Met in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Cancer manifests as uncontrolled cell proliferation. Tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase member, is vital in Wnt signal transmission, making it a promising cancer therapy target. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates critical biological processes like genomic stability, gene expression, energy utilization, and apoptosis. Its dysregulation contributes to cancer development. Targeting tankyrase within this pathway holds the potential for inhibiting aberrant cell growth and promoting programmed cell death, offering a promising avenue for cancer treatment. ADP-ribosylation, a reversible process, modifies proteins post-synthesis, regulating diverse cellular signaling pathways. Transferase enzymes like mono and poly(ADP- ribosyl) transferases transfer ADP-ribose from NAD+ to specific amino acid side chains or ADP-ribose units on target proteins. Blocking tankyrase has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer treatment. This article reviews recent advancements in developing novel tankyrase inhibitors. It delves into structure-activity relationships, molecular docking, polypharmacology profiles, and binding mechanisms at the active site. Insights into lead structure development aid in designing potent anti-cancer medications, shedding light on promising avenues in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cellular differentiation is controlled by intricate layers of gene regulation, involving the modulation of gene expression by various transcriptional regulators. Due to the complexity of gene regulation, identifying master regulators across the differentiation trajectory has been a longstanding challenge. To tackle this problem, a computational framework, single‐cell Boolean network inference and control (BENEIN), is presented. Applying BENEIN to human large intestinal single‐cell transcriptome data, MYB, HDAC2, and FOXA2 are identified as the master regulators whose inhibition induces enterocyte differentiation. It is found that simultaneous knockdown of these master regulators can revert colorectal cancer cells into normal‐like enterocytes by synergistically inducing differentiation and suppressing malignancy, which is validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.">

        <tr id="The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle essential for various cellular functions, particularly signal transduction. While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal epithelial cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation impairs ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited defective distal appendage formation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicular docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels. Summary This study investigates how modulating Wnt signaling affects ciliogenesis in human retinal epithelial cells, revealing that both excessive and insufficient Wnt activity disrupt cilia formation and highlighting the interplay between Wnt and mTOR signaling in this process.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (signaling pathway is involved in numerous important mammal cell functions, such as growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Associated with this, it is involved in tissue normal development and growth, tumorigenesis, and in tissue repair. Epidermal growth factor receptor is broadly expressed in the organism, including in the central and peripheral nervous system, where it has important neurotrophic functions. The central nervous system has a limited capacity for regeneration upon lesion, leading to severe disabilities, such as blindness, sensorimotor deficits, and paralysis. However, observations suggest that its innate neurogenic response may be amplified to promote the replenishment of damaged neuronal populations. In addition, the environment can also be modulated to promote regeneration. Therefore, the pathways involved in neural tissue repair have been investigated in terms of regenerative medicine, to discover new therapies to recover from traumatic injury or ischemia in the central nervous system or to inhibit the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Growth factors have been widely accepted as the most important promoters of proliferation and neurogenesis under physiologic conditions and after injury. In this review, we summarize how the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway is involved in neuronal damage and neurodegeneration in several settings, including in the olfactory epithelium, brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, where this pathway can be modulated in the context of regenerative medicine to promote neuronal regeneration and, therefore, neurological function reestablishment in response to insults.">

        <tr id="The integration between the tumor-suppressive and oncogenic signaling pathways controls various cellular activities of cancer cells, including cell growth and apoptosis. While the activation of oncogenes fuels cancer progression and escape mechanisms, tumor suppressors regulate and counterbalance the negative effects of oncogenic signaling. Notably, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) constitute one of the important family members of tumor suppressor genes, which play critical roles in regulating the activities of tumor cells. Thus, an impaired, mutated, or loss of PTEN is associated with low survival or high tumor recurrence rates in cancer patients. Importantly, high tumor expression of a G-protein coupled platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAFR) is associated with increased tumor progression as well as decreased overall survival and poor prognosis in malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Along similar lines, overactivation or mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling are detected in various human malignancies and associated with poor prognosis. The goal of the current minireview was to highlight the significance of the mechanistic insights between the PTEN and PAFR as well as the PAFR and EGFR pathways in impacting cancer growth and/or efficacy of therapeutic agents in experimental model systems.">

        <tr id="The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes led to a better understanding of tumorigenesis, and prompted the development of molecularly targeted therapy. Over the past 30 years, many new drugs, which are primarily aimed at activated oncogenic proteins in signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival, have been introduced in the clinic. Despite its rational design, the overall efficacy of targeted therapy has been modest. Recently, the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of important cellular processes in addition to the known regulatory proteins. It now appears that dual epigenetic regulatory systems exist in higher eukaryotic cells: a ncRNA network that governs essential cell functions, like cell fate decision and maintenance of homeostasis, and a protein-based system that presides over core physiological processes, like cell division and genomic maintenance. Modifications of the ncRNA network due to altered ncRNAs can cause the cell to shift towards to neoplastic phenotype; this is cancer initiation. Mutations in the well-known cancer driver genes provide the incipient cancer cell with a selective growth advantage and fuel its consequent clonal expansion. Because of the crucial role of the altered ncRNAs in tumorigenesis, targeting them may be a reasonable therapeutic strategy.">

        <tr id="KRAS was long deemed undruggable until the discovery of the switch-II pocket facilitated the development of specific KRAS inhibitors. Despite their introduction into clinical practice, resistance mechanisms can limit their effectiveness. Initially, tumors rely on mutant KRAS, but as they progress, they may shift to alternative pathways, resulting in intrinsic resistance. This resistance can stem from mechanisms like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), YAP activation, or KEAP1 mutations. KRAS inhibition often triggers cellular rewiring to counteract therapeutic pressure. For instance, feedback reactivation of signaling pathways such as MAPK, mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, supports tumor cell survival. Inhibiting KRAS disrupts protein homeostasis, but reactivation of MAPK or AKT can restore it, aiding tumor cell survival. KRAS inhibition also causes metabolic reprogramming and protein re-localization. The re-localization of E-cadherin and Scribble from the membrane to the cytosol causes YAP to translocate to the nucleus, where it drives MRAS transcription, leading to MAPK reactivation. Emerging evidence indicates that changes in cell identity, such as mucinous differentiation, shifts from alveolar type 2 to type 1 cells, or lineage switching from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma, also contribute to resistance. In addition to these nongenetic mechanisms, secondary mutations in KRAS or alterations in upstream/downstream signaling proteins can cause acquired resistance. Secondary mutations in the switch-II pocket disrupt drug binding, and known oncogenic mutations affect drug efficacy. Overcoming these resistance mechanisms involves enhancing the efficacy of drugs targeting mutant KRAS, developing broad-spectrum inhibitors, combining therapies targeting multiple pathways, and integrating immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Defects in cranial neural tube closure are among the most common and deleterious human structural birth defects. Correct cranial closure requires the coordination of multiple cell dynamic programs including cell proliferation and cell shape change. Mutations that impact Wnt signaling, including loss of the pathway co-receptor LRP6, lead to defects in cranial neural tube closure indicating that this pathway is an important mediator of this critical morphogenetic event, but the cellular dynamics under control of the Wnt pathway during closure remain unclear. Here, we use mice mutant for LRP6 to examine the consequences of conditional and global reduction in Wnt signaling, as well as conditional inactivation of APC to examine the consequences of pathway hyperactivation. Strikingly, we find that regulated Wnt signaling is required for two independent events during cranial neural tube closure. First, global reduction of Wnt leads to a surprising hyperplasia of the cranial neural folds driven by excessive cell proliferation at early pre-elevation stages. The increased tissue volume presents a mechanical blockade to efficient closure despite normal apical constriction and cell polarization at later stages. Conversely, conditional hyperactivation of the pathway at elevation stages prevents apical constriction and neural fold elevation but has no impact on cell polarization or proliferation. Together these data reveal that Wnt signaling levels must be modulated to restrict proliferation at early stages and allow for apical constriction later at elevation stages to promote efficient closure of the cranial neural tube.">

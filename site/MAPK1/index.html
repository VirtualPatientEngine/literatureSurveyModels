        <tr id="General and simple principles are identified that govern signal transduction. The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude, duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal −1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF‐induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration. Implications for the cellular decision between growth and differentiation are discussed.">

        <tr id="The Notch, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, and EGF pathways have long been known to influence cell fate specification in the developing nervous system. Here we attempted to evaluate the contemporary knowledge about neural stem cell differentiation promoted by various drug-based regulations through a systems biology approach. Our model showed the phenomenon of DAPT-mediated antagonism of Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes and enhancement of Shh target genes by a SAG agonist that were effectively demonstrated computationally and were consistent with experimental studies. However, in the case of model simulation of Wnt and EGF pathways, the model network did not supply any concurrent results with experimental data despite the fact that drugs were added at the appropriate positions. This paves insight into the potential of crosstalks between pathways considered in our study. Therefore, we manually developed a map of signaling crosstalk, which included the species connected by representatives from Notch, Shh, Wnt, and EGF pathways and highlighted the regulation of a single target gene, Hes-1, based on drug-induced simulations. These simulations provided results that matched with experimental studies. Therefore, these signaling crosstalk models complement as a tool toward the discovery of novel regulatory processes involved in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation during mammalian central nervous system development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a simple crosstalk map that highlights the differential regulation of neural stem cell differentiation and underscores the flow of positive and negative regulatory signals modulated by drugs.">

        <tr id="Relapse and metastasis are the major challenges that stand in the way of cancer healing and survival, mainly attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Their capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenic potential leads to treatment resistance development. CSCs function through signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. While commonly involved in embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis, the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway has direct correlations with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The development of therapies that target CSCs and bulk tumors is both crucial and urgent. However, the extensive crosstalk present between Wnt and other signaling networks (Hedgehog and Notch) complicates the development of efficient long-term therapies with minimal side-effects on normal tissues. Despite the obstacles, the emergence of Wnt inhibitors and subsequent modulation of the signaling pathways would provide dynamic therapeutic approaches to impairing CSCs and reversing resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The Wnt signaling pathway is critical in the onset and progression of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Anomalies in this pathway, often stemming from mutations in critical components such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or β-catenin, lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. In the case of colorectal cancer, dysregulation of the Wnt pathway drives tumor initiation and growth. Similarly, aberrant Wnt signaling contributes to tumor development, metastasis, and resistance to therapy in other GI cancers, such as gastric, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Targeting the Wnt pathway or its downstream effectors has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for combating these highly aggressive GI malignancies. Here, we review the dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and further explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the various components of the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, we summarize and integrate the preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy of potent Wnt pathway inhibitors with completed and ongoing clinical trials in GI cancers. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of Wnt pathway-targeted therapies in GI cancers to overcome these concerns for effective clinical translation.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in the medical field in this century, largely due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. Fortunately, recent advancements in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis have helped identify more therapeutic targets for improved treatment outcomes. The WNT signaling pathways are highly conserved cascades that participate in diverse physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. Ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, is driven by lipid peroxidation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Emerging evidence shows that the dysregulation of WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis, as well as their intricate crosstalk, plays crucial roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, indicating their potential as targets for cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the crosstalk between WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer, with a specific focus on the regulatory role of the canonical WNT cascade in cancer-related ferroptosis. In addition, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms of current strategies that inhibit canonical WNT signaling and/or induce ferroptosis in cancer treatment. We propose that combining canonical WNT pathway inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers and current therapies represents a promising therapeutic strategy for personalized cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterized by significant morbidity and mortality rates, poses a substantial threat to human health. The expression of ligands and receptors within the classical and non-classical Wnt signaling pathways plays an important role in HCC. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for regulating multiple biological processes in HCC, including proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor microenvironment modulation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell characteristics, and autophagy. Molecular agents that specifically target the Wnt signaling pathway have demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of HCC. However, the precise mechanism by which the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with HCC remains unclear. In this paper, we review the alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC, the mechanism of Wnt pathway action in HCC, and molecular agents targeting the Wnt pathway. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for identifying molecular agents targeting the Wnt pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.">

        <tr id="Wnt (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) signaling is an evolutionary conserved system highly active during embryogenesis, but in adult hearts has low activities under normal conditions. It is essential for a variety of physiological processes including stem cell regeneration, proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and morphogenesis, thereby ensuring homeostasis and regeneration of cardiac tissue. Its dysregulation and excessive activation during pathological conditions leads to morphological and functional changes in the heart resulting in impaired myocardial regeneration under pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Several groups of Wnt inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to modulate the Wnt pathway and thereby significantly reduce fibrosis and improve cardiac function after myocardial ischemia. Their inhibitory effect can be realized at multiple levels, which include the inhibition of Wnt ligands, the inhibition of Frizzled receptors, the stabilization of the β-catenin destruction complex, and the disruption of nuclear β-catenin interactions. In this review, we overview the function of Wnt signaling in responses of cardiac cells to pathological conditions, especially ischemic heart disease, with an emphasis on the use of inhibitors of this signaling as a therapeutic approach. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge about the potential of the targeting of Wnt signaling in therapeutic applications.">

Currently, it is known that an error in the Wnt/-catenin pathway is an essential cause of intestinal cancers. After the inhibitors and markers involved in it are especially studied, targeted therapy has already been considered by the scientists. However, there is only overall understanding in Wnt/-catenin pathway with many detailed mechanisms uncleared, thus no treatments can be put into practice. This article analyses proteins and factors which have the potential of being used as targets of targeted therapy. Besides, essential inhibitors, such as NEDD4 and E7386, of the Wnt/-catenin pathway and how lack of them lead to oncogenesis are introduced. Furthermore, the possibility and examples of targeted medicine is discussed. This review offers a wider view of the entire mechanism of intestinal cancers spurred by Wnt/-catenin pathways.

This review systematically explores the critical roles of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma (GBM), especially through the regulation of Notch, Wnt, and Hh signaling pathways. The maintenance of CSC properties is primarily dependent on the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways. This review explores the mechanisms of these pathways in GBM, discusses multi-targeted combination therapies, and highlights emerging strategies and drugs for targeted therapy. The results indicate that targeting Notch, Wnt, and Hh pathways can effectively suppress CSC proliferation and invasiveness in GBM, significantly delaying tumor recurrence. Future research should further explore the clinical potential of these pathway inhibitors and develop more specific targeted therapies to improve GBM treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.">

        <tr id="Cancer sparks if the components of the cellular signaling network are aberrantly activated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. One of the most important players of this highly regulated network is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with a significant role in human health and disease. The critical co-receptor of this pathway, LRP6, is overexpressed in various cancer types and is a target for therapy. Therefore, understanding the details of the LRP6 structural activation mechanism is of tremendous importance. This research intended to compare the structural-dynamics features of the E3E4 functional domain of LRP6 induced by the activator Wnt3a and the inhibitor, Dkk1_C, compared with the receptor behavior in the apo-state. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and G_MMPBSA calculation, we characterized overlapping binding regions of Wnt3a and Dkk1_C on E3E4. Despite their overall similar interacting regions, Dkk1_C and Wnt induce remarkably different inter-blades hydrogen bonds, structural-dynamics behavior, and conformational energy landscape in E3E4. According to our findings, Dkk1_C stabilized the interaction. between BP3 blades 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 and BP4 blades 1-6, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4, aligned with apo-state. However, on the other hand, Wnt distinguishably destabilized the hydrogen bond networks of these blades. Our DCCM analysis also depicted a similar correlation pattern of apo and Dkk1-bound states, and dramatic differences in Wnt-bound state, with a specific enhancement of correlated movements in EGF4. These data provide atomistic-level clues of how natural regulators of Wnt signaling manipulate LRP6 dynamics and, therefore, guide the structure-based design of efficient artificial inhibitors/activators for the pathway.">

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent chronic disease that is becoming increasingly common worldwide and can lead to a number of dangerous complications. The Wnt signaling pathway is important for the onset and progression of diabetes. Wnt3a is a typical Wnt ligand that can increase the stability of β-catenin, control TCF7L2 expression, promote β-cell proliferation, and reduce apoptosis.


SUMMARY
The involvement of the Wnt3a/β-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling pathway in the development of diabetes and associated problems related to the kidneys is reviewed in this article.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is infamous for its aggressive phenotype and poorer prognosis when compared to other breast cancer subtypes. One factor contributing to this poor prognosis is that TNBC lacks expression of the receptors that available hormonal or molecular-oriented therapies attack. New treatments that exploit biological targets specific to TNBC are desperately needed to improve patient outcomes. One promising target for therapeutic manipulation is the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with many invasive breast cancers, including TNBC. This pathway is activated in TNBC cells when extracellular Wnt ligands bind to overexpressed Frizzled7 (FZD7) transmembrane receptors, leading to downstream activation of intracellular β-catenin proteins. To target and inhibit Wnt signaling in TNBC cells, polymer nanoparticles (NPs) modified with anti-FZD7 antibodies and β-catenin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were developed, and their impact on the oncogenic behavior of treated TNBC cells was investigated. When compared to control NPs, the Wnt-targeted NPs induced greater levels of Wnt oncogene suppression. This led to greater inhibition of oncogenic and stem-like properties, including cell proliferation, drug resistance, and spheroid formation capacity. This work demonstrates a promising approach for targeting the Wnt pathway in TNBC to counter the cellular phenotypes that drive disease progression.">

        <tr id="The PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling pathways are integral to fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, viability, and differentiation. In granulosa cells (GCs), these pathways are activated by FSH and IGF1 through respective receptors. We investigated the comparative transcriptome changes induced by AKT and ERK pathways using corresponding inhibitors in GCs. GCs isolated from antral follicles showed positive signals for phospho-AKT and -ERK proteins. Treatment of cultured GCs with FSH and IGF1 induced phospho-AKT and -ERK levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1436 genes regulated by AKT and 654 genes regulated by ERK pathway. Among these, 94 genes were commonly downregulated, and 11 genes were commonly upregulated in both data sets, while 110 genes were oppositely regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways downregulates key reproductive processes and upstream molecules. Notably, AKT inhibition affected FSH, ESRRG, and HIF1 pathways, while ERK inhibition impacted CG, FOS, TGFβ, EGR1, and LH pathways. Transcriptome data showed that genes related to estradiol production were inhibited by ERK and induced by the AKT pathway. This was verified by radioimmunoassays, and mRNA and protein analysis of CYP19A1 and STAR genes. In addition, transcriptome data suggested downregulation of glucose metabolism in GCs. Using validation experiments, we confirm that both pathways are essential for glucose uptake, lactate production, and mitochondrial activity in GCs. These data provide a resource for informing future research for analyzing various novel candidate genes regulated by AKT and ERK pathways in GCs and other cell types.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of the Wnt1/β-catenin signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be a driving factor in the propagation of several human cancers. Previous studies have discovered methyl 3-{[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amino}benzoate (MSAB) as a selective inhibitor of the Wnt1/β-catenin signaling pathway, which putatively functions through direct engagement of β-catenin. To understand how changes to the identity and position of the methyl ester affect the in vitro potency of this compound in Wnt1-driven mammalian cell lines, we prepared and evaluated three analogs of MSAB with 3- and 4-substituted methyl and ethyl esters. In MTT assays, analogs with methyl esters showed significantly more activity than their ethyl ester counterparts and both 4-substituted esters exhibited significantly attenuated antiproliferative activity, with MSAB exhibiting dose-dependent activity across cancerous cell lines. Further analysis by flow cytometry reveals low-Annexin V signal, suggesting that these compounds do not function via a pro-apoptotic pathway. Additionally, through a TCF/LEF-activated luciferase reporter cell assay, we observe that the 4-substituted methyl ester analogous to MSAB exhibits slightly diminished Wnt1-inhibitory activity, while 3- and 4-substituted ethyl esters exhibit minimal Wnt1-inhibitory activity. This difference in potency with a simple ester substitution might be attributed to several factors that ultimately drive antiproliferative activity, prompting the investigation of other potential substituents to further investigate the structure-activity relationship of these compounds as Wnt1-based antiproliferative agents.">

        <tr id="Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a dangerous neurological disease associated with an imbalance in Th17/Treg cells and abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study aims to investigate whether inhibition of miR-155 can activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to improve Th17/Treg imbalance and provide neuroprotective effects against stroke. We employed a multi-level experimental design. Firstly, we analyzed the differential gene expression between the miR-155 antagomir-treated group and the control group using high-throughput sequencing to identify potential target genes. Subsequently, we conducted functional and pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes using bioinformatics tools. Next, we performed in vivo animal experiments using a mouse model to validate the impact of miR-155 antagomir treatment on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and improvement of Th17/Treg cell ratios. Lastly, we conducted in vitro cell experiments to validate our findings further. High-throughput sequencing results showed significant differential expression between the miR-155 antagomir-treated group and the control group (BioProject: PRJNA1152758, SRA IDs: SRR30410532, SRR30410531, SRR30410530 for the disease group; SRR30410529, SRR30410528, SRR30410527 for the control group). Bioinformatics analysis revealed potential target genes associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and Th17/Treg cell imbalance. In vitro experiments demonstrated that miR-155 antagomir treatment significantly activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and improved Th17/Treg cell ratios. In vivo, animal experiment results indicated that miR-155 antagomir treatment exhibited significant neuroprotective effects against AIS. This study demonstrates that miR-155 antagomir can improve Th17/Treg cell imbalance by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and exhibiting neuroprotective effects against AIS in a mouse model. These findings provide crucial support for miR-155 as a potential therapeutic strategy for stroke and lay the foundation for further research.Significance Statement This study identifies miR-155 as a pivotal regulator of the Th17/Treg cell balance and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in AIS. By inhibiting miR-155, we demonstrate the potential to enhance neuroprotection and modulate immune responses, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for stroke management. These findings contribute to the growing understanding of molecular mechanisms in stroke and provide a foundation for developing miR-155-targeted therapies.">

In the early 2000's, genetic alterations of MACF1 were identified in several cancers suggesting that this cytoskeletal crosslinker was involved in tumor development and progression, while preclinical studies provided evidence that MACF1 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in glioblastomas, a central nervous system cancer derived from astrocytes and neural progenitor stem cells. Furthermore, investigations in glioblastomas demonstrated that genetic inhibitory targeting of this spectraplakin protein alone and in combination with DNA damaging agents had synergistic antitumorigenic effects. The established role of MACF1 in Wnt signaling, a known mechanistic driver of central nervous system development and pro-tumorigenic cell behavior in glioblastomas, provide a premise for addressing the potential of this spectraplakin protein as a novel oncoprotein in cancers with origins in the nervous system. The present review provides a summary of the role and function of MACF1 in the central nervous system, Wnt signaling and cancer development, specifically as an oncoprotein that underlie the transformation and oncogenic properties of glioblastomas.">

        <tr id="The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade, coordinates with many intracellular signals and mediates the regulation of the activities of various downstream transcription factors and their coactivators to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, the aberrant activation of the Hippo pathway and its associated molecules imposes significant stress on tissues and cells, leading to cancer, immune disorders, and a number of diseases. Cellular senescence, the mechanism by which cells counteract stress, prevents cells from unnecessary damage and leads to sustained cell cycle arrest. It acts as a powerful defense mechanism against normal organ development and aging-related diseases. On the other hand, the accumulation of senescent cells without their proper removal contributes to the development or worsening of cancer and age-related diseases. A correlation was recently reported between the Hippo pathway and cellular senescence, which preserves tissue homeostasis. This review is the first to describe the close relationship between aging and the Hippo pathway, and provides insights into the mechanisms of aging and the development of age-related diseases. In addition, it describes advanced findings that may lead to the development of tissue regeneration therapies and drugs targeting rejuvenation.">

        <tr id="Cell states evolve through the combined activity of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. While transcription factors can direct cell fate, these factors rely on a cell state that is receptive to transitions in cell identity. How signaling levels contribute to the emergence of receptive cell states remains poorly defined in primary cells. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, we examined how levels of the MAPK-activating oncogene HRASG12V influence direct conversion of primary fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. We demonstrate that an optimal ‘Goldilocks’ level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Rates of direct conversion respond biphasically to increasing HRASG12V levels. While intermediate HRASG12V levels increase the rate of conversion, high levels of HRASG12V induce senescence. Through chemogenetic tuning, we set optimal MAPK activity for high rates of conversion in the absence of HRAS mutants. As MAPK pathways influence cell-fate transitions in development and disease, our results highlight the need to tune therapeutic interventions within a non-monotonic landscape that is shaped by genetics and levels of gene expression.

        <tr id="Ion channels play a crucial role in cardiac functions, and their activities exhibit dynamic changes during heart development. However, the precise function of ion channels in human heart development remains elusive. In this study, we utilized human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model to mimic the process of human embryonic heart development. During hESCs differentiation into cardiomyocytes, we observed differential expression of ion channel genes, including upregulation of ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), which encodes a calcium release channel. Subsequently, we discovered that Suramin, an activator of RyR2, efficiently promoted cardiac differentiation even in the absence of conventional WNT inhibitors. Furthermore, various modulators targeting sodium channels, potassium channels or chloride channels were examined under chemically defined conditions during cardiac differentiation. We found that DIDS, a chloride transport inhibitor, also enhanced hESCs differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Both Suramin and DIDS partially inhibited WNT signaling pathway, and RYR2 knockdown attenuated cardiac differentiation induced by WNT inhibitor treatment, or Suramin or DIDS administration. The resulting cardiomyocytes induced by these ion modulators exhibited specific expression patterns of cardiac genes and displayed typical electrophysiological signals. Notably, compared to WNT inhibitor treatment group, both Suramin and DIDS led to increased generation of atrial-like cardiomyocytes suggesting their potential as alternative inducers for specific cardiomyocyte lineage commitment during human cardiomyocyte induction processes. This study demonstrates that regulation of ion channels plays a crucial role in determining the fate of cardiac cells, providing an effective approach for inducing cardiomyocytes from hPSCs and highlighting their critical involvement in human heart development.">

The goal of this study is to elucidate the specific function of MKP in the regulation of MAPK signaling and to identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with MAPK dysregulation. In this study, the interaction between MKP and MAPK signaling was investigated using cellular models and biochemical experiments. The primary targets were cells expressing MAPK and MKP, and protein-protein interactions and signaling dynamics were analyzed using methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. According to this study, MKP is crucial for the exact temporal and spatial modulation of MAPK signaling through its negative regulation. An imbalance in this balance can lead to pathological conditions. This study highlights the importance of MKP in cellular homeostasis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent.">

        <tr id="The scaffold protein IQGAP3 is highly upregulated in most epithelial cancers. While recent studies have highlighted its pivotal roles in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, a deeper mechanistic understanding of IQGAP3 is currently lacking. We have here used TurboID to map IQGAP3 proximity partners and identified the Wnt signaling members Axin1 and CK1α as IQGAP3-interacting proteins. Our functional studies demonstrated that overexpression of IQGAP3 increases β-catenin levels, while IQGAP3 depletion reduces β-catenin levels in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, IQGAP3 disrupts Axin1-CK1α interaction, thereby inhibiting β- catenin phosphorylation and ultimately leading to its accumulation. Importantly, we discovered that IQGAP3 itself is regulated by Wnt signaling, suggesting its involvement in a positive feedback loop in Wnt/β-catenin signaling through interactions with Axin1 and CK1α. These findings identify IQGAP3 as a novel mediator of β-catenin stabilization and underscore its potential as a target for cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway is a key player in animal development and physiology. Although it functions in a variety of processes, the net output of JAK-STAT signalling depends on its spatiotemporal activation, as well as extensive crosstalk with other signalling pathways. Drosophila, with its relatively simple signal transduction pathways and plethora of genetic analysis tools, is an ideal system for dissecting JAK-STAT signalling interactions. In this review, we explore studies in Drosophila revealing that JAK-STAT signalling lies at the nexus of a complex network of interlinked pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Notch, Insulin, Hippo, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Hedgehog (Hh) and Wingless (Wg). These pathways can synergise with or antagonise one another to produce a variety of outcomes.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Breast cancer is an intricate condition that is caused by aberrant cell signaling regulation induced by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. It is well known that various downstream signaling cascades (JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK) are activated in transformed cells to regulate tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, therapy failure, and stemness. However, the complex signaling networks and their crosstalk is challenged by structural alterations, aberrant gene amplification, and activation of alternative pathways.">

        <tr id=": The KRAS gene is nearly ubiquitously subjected to activating mutation in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC), occurring at a frequency of over 90% in tumors. Mutant KRAS drives sustained signaling through the MAPK pathway to affect frequently disrupted cancer phenotypes including transcription, proliferation and cell survival. Recent research has shown that PDAC tumor growth and survival required a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS homolog family member A (RhoA) called GEF-H1. The GEF-H1 protein, encoded by the ARHGEF2 gene, is a microtubule-associated GEF for RhoA that promotes invasion-migration of PDAC cells via activation of RhoA. Unexpectedly, independent of its RhoGEF activity, GEF-H1 was found to potentiate MAPK signaling by scaffolding protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR-1). In a feedback-dependent manner, enhanced MAPK activity drives expression of ARHGEF2 via regulation of transcription factors ETS and SP, and the RAS responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB1). RREB1 a negative regulator of ARHGEF2 expression, is downregulated in PDAC cells, which permits sustained expression of GEF-H1 for PDAC tumor survival and subsequent MAPK pathway activation. Given that MAPK targeted therapies show limited clinical efficacy, highlights the need for novel targets. This review describes the unexpected complexity of GEF-H1 function leading to positive feedback that potentiates RAS-MAPK signaling and suggests inhibition of GEF-H1 as a therapeutic strategy for RAS-driven cancers.">

        <tr id="The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle essential for various cellular functions, particularly signal transduction. While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal epithelial cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation impairs ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited defective distal appendage formation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicular docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels. Summary This study investigates how modulating Wnt signaling affects ciliogenesis in human retinal epithelial cells, revealing that both excessive and insufficient Wnt activity disrupt cilia formation and highlighting the interplay between Wnt and mTOR signaling in this process.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cellular differentiation is controlled by intricate layers of gene regulation, involving the modulation of gene expression by various transcriptional regulators. Due to the complexity of gene regulation, identifying master regulators across the differentiation trajectory has been a longstanding challenge. To tackle this problem, a computational framework, single‐cell Boolean network inference and control (BENEIN), is presented. Applying BENEIN to human large intestinal single‐cell transcriptome data, MYB, HDAC2, and FOXA2 are identified as the master regulators whose inhibition induces enterocyte differentiation. It is found that simultaneous knockdown of these master regulators can revert colorectal cancer cells into normal‐like enterocytes by synergistically inducing differentiation and suppressing malignancy, which is validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.">

        <tr id="Cancer manifests as uncontrolled cell proliferation. Tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase member, is vital in Wnt signal transmission, making it a promising cancer therapy target. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates critical biological processes like genomic stability, gene expression, energy utilization, and apoptosis. Its dysregulation contributes to cancer development. Targeting tankyrase within this pathway holds the potential for inhibiting aberrant cell growth and promoting programmed cell death, offering a promising avenue for cancer treatment. ADP-ribosylation, a reversible process, modifies proteins post-synthesis, regulating diverse cellular signaling pathways. Transferase enzymes like mono and poly(ADP- ribosyl) transferases transfer ADP-ribose from NAD+ to specific amino acid side chains or ADP-ribose units on target proteins. Blocking tankyrase has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer treatment. This article reviews recent advancements in developing novel tankyrase inhibitors. It delves into structure-activity relationships, molecular docking, polypharmacology profiles, and binding mechanisms at the active site. Insights into lead structure development aid in designing potent anti-cancer medications, shedding light on promising avenues in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway is central to various biological processes, including tissue regeneration, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in cancer progression and poor prognosis. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, the complexity of HGF/c-Met signaling and the associated challenges, such as off-target effects and limited understanding of its role in different disease contexts, pose significant obstacles to clinical translation.
Objectives: This review aims to examine the role of the HGF/c-Met pathway in tissue regeneration and cancer, with a focus on its therapeutic potential. We explore how HGF/c-Met signaling contributes to stem cell function, tissue repair, and cancer biology, as well as the development of targeted therapies aimed at modulating this pathway.
Methods: A thorough review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies examining HGF/c-Met signaling in cancer and tissue regeneration. Relevant research databases were explored to identify key findings related to HGF/c-Met interactions, the effects of HGF on stem cell function, and the development of therapeutic agents targeting this pathway.
Conclusions: The HGF/c-Met pathway holds significant promise in both cancer treatment and tissue regeneration, particularly through its role in stem cell biology. Further research is needed to better understand its mechanisms and optimize targeted therapies. Combining pharmacological agents that modulate HGF/c-Met signaling with personalized treatment approaches could enhance therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients. Addressing current limitations, including the refinement of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, will be essential in fully harnessing the potential of HGF/c-Met in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (signaling pathway is involved in numerous important mammal cell functions, such as growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Associated with this, it is involved in tissue normal development and growth, tumorigenesis, and in tissue repair. Epidermal growth factor receptor is broadly expressed in the organism, including in the central and peripheral nervous system, where it has important neurotrophic functions. The central nervous system has a limited capacity for regeneration upon lesion, leading to severe disabilities, such as blindness, sensorimotor deficits, and paralysis. However, observations suggest that its innate neurogenic response may be amplified to promote the replenishment of damaged neuronal populations. In addition, the environment can also be modulated to promote regeneration. Therefore, the pathways involved in neural tissue repair have been investigated in terms of regenerative medicine, to discover new therapies to recover from traumatic injury or ischemia in the central nervous system or to inhibit the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Growth factors have been widely accepted as the most important promoters of proliferation and neurogenesis under physiologic conditions and after injury. In this review, we summarize how the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway is involved in neuronal damage and neurodegeneration in several settings, including in the olfactory epithelium, brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, where this pathway can be modulated in the context of regenerative medicine to promote neuronal regeneration and, therefore, neurological function reestablishment in response to insults.">

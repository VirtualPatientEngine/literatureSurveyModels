        <tr id="To help understand the complex and therapeutically challenging inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), we developed a systems biology model of the intestinal immune system that is able to describe main aspects of IBD and different treatment modalities thereof. The model, including key cell types and processes of the mucosal immune response, compiles a large amount of isolated experimental findings from literature into a larger context and allows for simulations of different inflammation scenarios based on the underlying data and assumptions. In the context of a large and diverse virtual IBD population, we characterized the patients based on their phenotype (in contrast to healthy individuals, they developed persistent inflammation after a trigger event) rather than on a priori assumptions on parameter differences to a healthy individual. This allowed to reproduce the enormous diversity of predispositions known to lead to IBD. Analyzing different treatment effects, the model provides insight into characteristics of individual drug therapy. We illustrate for anti‐TNF‐α therapy, how the model can be used (i) to decide for alternative treatments with best prospects in the case of nonresponse, and (ii) to identify promising combination therapies with other available treatment options.">

        <tr id="Crohn’s Disease (CD) results from inappropriate response toward commensal flora. Earlier studies described CD as a Th1 mediated disease. Current models view both phenotypes as a continuum of various permutations between Th1, Th2 and Th17 pathways compounded by a range of Treg disfunctions. In the present paper, we develop a mathematical model, by a system of differential equations, which describe the dynamic relations among these T cells and their cytokines. The model identities four groups of CD patients according to up/down regulation of Th1 and Th2. The model simulations show that immunosuppression by TNF-α blockage benefits the group with Th1High/Th2Low while, by contrast, the group with Th1Low/Th2High will benefit from immune activation.">

        <tr id="Several PI3K inhibitors are in clinical development for the treatment of various forms of cancers, including pan‐PI3K inhibitors targeting all four PI3K isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ), and isoform‐selective inhibitors. Diarrhea and immune‐mediated colitis are among the adverse events observed with PI3K inhibition which limits the maximal tolerated dose. A quantitative systems pharmacology model was developed to investigate PI3K‐inhibitor‐induced colitis. The effects of individual PI3K isoforms on relevant cellular pathways were incorporated into a mechanistic representation of mucosal inflammation. A virtual clinical population captures the observed clinical variability in the onset timing and rates of diarrhea and colitis for seven clinically tested PI3K inhibitors. Model‐based analysis suggests that colitis development is governed by both the inhibition of PI3Kδ, which drives T cell differentiation and proliferation, and PI3Kα, which regulates epithelial barrier integrity. Specifically, when PI3Kα is inhibited below a given threshold, epithelial barrier dysfunction precipitates an exaggerated T effector response due to PI3Kδ‐inhibition, leading to risk of diarrhea and colitis. This synergy explains why the lowest diarrhea and colitis rates are seen with the weakest PI3Kδ inhibition (alpelisib), and higher rates are seen with strong PI3Kδ inhibition if PI3Kα is even mildly inhibited (e.g., idelalisib), whereas strong PI3Kδ inhibition in the absence of PI3Kα inhibition does not result in high colitis rates (umbralisib). Thus, the model‐based analysis suggests that PI3Kα and δ inhibition play unique but synergistic roles in driving colitis. Finally, we explore if and how dose‐regimen might influence colitis rates for molecules that inhibit both PI3Kα and PI3Kδ.">

        <tr id="A mechanistic, multistate, mathematical model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was developed by including key biological mechanisms in blood and gut, including cell differentiation, cytokine production, and clinical biomarkers. The model structure is consistent between healthy volunteers and IBD disease phenotype, with 24 parameters changed between diseases. Modular nature of the model allows for easy incorporation of new mechanisms or modification of existing interactions. Model simulations for steady‐state levels of proteins and cells in the blood and gut using a population approach are consistent with published data. By simulating the response of two clinical biomarkers, C‐reactive protein and fecal calprotectin, to parameter perturbations, the model explores hypotheses for possible treatment mechanisms. With additional experimental validation and addition of drug treatments, the model provides a platform to test hypothesis on treatment effects in IBD.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disease with multiple underlying influences and notable heterogeneity among its clinical and response‐to‐treatment phenotypes. There is no cure for IBD, and none of the currently available therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacies beyond 40%–60%. Data collected about its omics, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies have grown exponentially with time making IBD a prime candidate for artificial intelligence (AI) mediated discovery support. AI can be leveraged to further understand or identify IBD features to improve clinical outcomes. Various treatment candidates are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, offering further approaches and opportunities for increasing the efficacies of treatments. However, currently, therapeutic plans are largely determined using clinical features due to the lack of specific biomarkers, and it has become necessary to step into precision medicine to predict therapeutic responses to guarantee optimal treatment efficacy. This is accompanied by the application of AI and the development of multiscale hybrid models combining mechanistic approaches and machine learning. These models ultimately lead to the creation of digital twins of given patients delivering on the promise of precision dosing and tailored treatment. Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a prominent cytokine in cell‐to‐cell communication in the inflammatory responses’ regulation. Dysregulated IL‐6‐induced signaling leads to severe immunological or proliferative pathologies, such as IBD and colon cancer. This mini‐review explores multiscale models with the aim of predicting the response to therapy in IBD. Modeling IL‐6 biology and generating digital twins enhance the credibility of their prediction.">

        <tr id="JAK1 inhibitors have become an important addition to the therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis (UC), targeting key inflammatory pathways mediated by cytokines such as the IL-6 family, interferons, IL-2 family, IL-10 family, and G-CSF. However, not all patients respond equally, and chronic inflammation persists in a subset of individuals. The variability in treatment response may reflect the heterogeneity of UC. Immune cells, epithelial cells, and stromal cells may have distinct contributions to disease pathogenesis. While JAK inhibitors were originally designed to target immune cells, their impact on non-immune cell types, such as epithelial and stromal cells, remains poorly understood. Investigating the mechanisms through which JAK1 inhibitors affect these diverse cellular populations and identifying the factors underlying differential responses is crucial to optimizing outcomes. This review explores the roles of immune, epithelial, and stromal cells in response to JAK1 inhibition and discusses potential strategies to improve treatment precision, such as predicting responders and identifying complementary therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Vitamin D holds a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Its mechanisms of action involve immune system modulation, specifically by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, while enhancing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. Furthermore, vitamin D contributes to the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity by strengthening epithelial tight junctions. It also exerts a beneficial influence on the intestinal microbiota, promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacterial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which play a role in mitigating disease relapses and sustaining immune homeostasis. Although vitamin D supplementation demonstrates potential in reducing inflammation and improving clinical outcomes, the observed effects remain varied and require further investigation. 
Aim: The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanisms of action of vitamin D in the context of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its potential therapeutic applications, with particular emphasis on clinical studies evaluating vitamin D supplementation.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a protracted, persistent gastrointestinal disease that is distinguished by recurring, persistent inflammation of the digestive tract. IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by persistent inflammation due to immune dysregulation. Interleukin -17 (IL-17) contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of IBD, as highlighted in the context of the provided research. There is a strong correlation between IL-17 inhibitors and the onset or exacerbation of IBD, with IL-17 inhibitor treatment being linked to gastrointestinal inflammatory events such as IBD and colitis. The goal of the current study was to determine the relationship between IBD disease activity and serum IL-17 levels in individuals with IBD. This case-control study included 102 IBD patients and 48 normal individuals as a control group. Blood samples were used for measuring IL-17 levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of IL-17 were increased in patients compared with the control group (p=0.0001). IL-17 levels were significantly elevated in patients aged 1-15 years, 31-45 years and 16-30 years. IL-17 levels showed significant differences between two types of inflammatory bowel disease being elevated in Crohn's disease more than ulcerative colitis (p=0.001). IL-17 demonstrated significant differences in IL-17 levels between male and female in patients and controls groups (p=0.0001). In conclusion, patients with IBD have higher serum levels of IL-17, indicating that these cytokines may have a role in the development and pathophysiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Overall, monitoring IL-17 levels could serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing IBD severity and guiding treatment decisions.">

        <tr id="Treatments for Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), two conditions that fall under the umbrella of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), must be both safe and effective. This review compares the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF agents and IL-12/23 inhibitors, specifically in the context of IBD management. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and meta-analyses involving adult IBD patients were all included in the review. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab and adalimumab) were shown to significantly improve clinical remission rates and reduce complications, particularly with early intervention. However, these agents were associated with adverse effects such as infections and autoimmune reactions. IL-12/23 inhibitors, particularly risankizumab, showed superior efficacy in achieving and maintaining remission with a better safety profile. The findings prove that IL-12/23 inhibitors might be more effective for patients who are unresponsive to anti-TNF therapies. In conclusion, both anti-TNF agents and IL-12/23 inhibitors effectively manage IBD, with IL-12/23 inhibitors offering a favorable safety profile. Early intervention and personalized treatment strategies are significant for optimizing patient outcomes. It will take additional research to validate these results and improve treatment strategies.Keywords: Anti-TNF Drugs, Crohn's Disease, IL-12/23 Inhibitors, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Ulcerative Colitis">

However, the precise etiology and pathogenesis remain under investigation in clinical practice. Extensive research has demonstrated that cytokines play a pivotal role in the development, occurrence, and prognosis of UC, with an imbalance between pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory factors being a significant contributor. Given that UC is challenging to cure, therapeutic options such as hormones and aminosalicylic acid are commonly employed. While treatments including Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and other approaches have shown some efficacy, substantial breakthroughs are still lacking. Cytokines, therefore, represent a critical focus in understanding the pathogenesis of UC. This review explores the therapeutic pathways of cytokines and their antagonists.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, with Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) being the most common. While still not fully understood, pathogenesis is believed to be multifactorial – the result of an interplay between genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation and environmental factors that all lead to chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling. Innate immune cells, which orchestrate the initial defense mechanisms and modulate the subsequent immune response, play a central role in disease initiation and progression. This review examines the complex involvement of innate immune cells in IBD, emphasizing their interactions with environmental factors and the gut microbiome. We highlight the importance of microbial dysbiosis and impaired intestinal barrier function in disease pathogenesis, and the role that innate immune cells play not only as first responders, but also as key players in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiome. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the role that innate immune cells play in IBD pathogenesis with emphasis on the increasingly recognized role of the gut microbiome. A better understanding of innate immune cell mechanisms and of microbiome-immune interactions is key for the development of novel targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with a complex aetiopathogenesis, whose development is influenced by many factors. The prevalence of IBD is increasing worldwide, in both industrialized and developing countries, making IBD a global health problem that seriously affects quality of life. In 2019, there were approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD worldwide. Such a large number of patients entails significant healthcare costs. In the treatment of patients with IBD, the current therapeutic target is mucosal healing, as intestinal inflammation often persists despite resolution of abdominal symptoms. Treatment strategies include amino salicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies that focus on reducing intestinal mucosal inflammation, inducing and prolonging disease remission, and treating complications. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines also indicate that nutritional therapies may be considered in addition to other therapies. However, current therapeutic approaches are not fully effective and are associated with various limitations, such as drug resistance, variable efficacy, and side effects. As the chronic inflammation that accompanies IBD is characterized by infiltration of a variety of immune cells and increased expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ, new therapeutic approaches are mainly targeting immune pathways. Interleukins are one of the molecular targets in IBD therapy. Interleukins and related cytokines serve as a means of communication for innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as nonimmune cells and tissues. These cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis and course of IBD, making them promising targets for current and future therapies. In our work, we review scientific studies published between January 2022 and November 2024 describing the most important interleukins involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Some of the papers present new data on the precise role that individual interleukins play in IBD. New clinical data have also been provided, particularly on blocking interleukin 23 and interleukin 1beta. In addition, several new approaches to the use of different interleukins in the treatment of IBD have been described in recent years.">

 Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal diseases driven by chronic reactivation of memory T helper (Thm) 1-like and Th17m cells, respectively. Disease remission remains difficult to achieve and maintain due to inter-patient heterogeneity in disease severity and underlying immune responses. Moreover, variations in the pathogenic Thm responses, the treatment target, are understudied. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 enhances IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by Th1 cells, as seen in Th1-driven inflammatory diseases. However, its potential pathogenic role in immune-mediated diseases, like CD and UC, is unclear. Upon investigating immune responses in therapy-naïve pediatric CD and UC patients, we detected increased IL-18 plasma concentrations that were correctable by therapy. We hypothesized that IL-18 plays a role in both CD and UC by stimulating Th1m but also Th17m cells, worsening disease.



 We examined therapy-naïve pediatric CD and UC patient plasma proteomics (92 proteins, Proximity Extension Assay technology; CD: n=85, UC: n =31, control: n=25), circulating gut-homing Thm populations, transcriptomes of intestinal biopsies (CD: n=57, UC: n =21, control: n=12), and clinical disease parameters. Further, we assessed cytokine responses by healthy donor-derived Th1m and Th17m cells after IL-18 and IL-12 stimulation in vitro.



 Plasma IL-18 concentrations correlated to concentrations of Th1-associated proteins (IFN-γ, CXCL9, CXCL11, CXCL10, PDL1) in CD and UC. Interestingly, in UC patients, IL-18 concentrations also correlated to Th17-associated proteins (IL-12B, IL-17A, IL-24). In agreement, preliminary in vitro data showed that IL-18 + IL-12 stimulation increases IL-17A- and IFN-γ-secreting cell frequencies in CCR6+ Th17m cells. In CD, plasma IL-18 concentrations correlated to frequencies of circulating gut-homing CCR6+CXCR3+CCR4+ Th17m, a pathogenic population known to acquire Th1 features and IFN-γ production. Ileal and colonic mRNA expression of IL-18 pathway genes associated with degree of histological inflammation. Higher IL-18 plasma concentrations at diagnosis associated with moderate to severe disease and worse endoscopic scores in both CD and UC and greater disease extent in UC, suggesting a relationship between IL-18 and disease severity. In line with its preferential production in the ileum, plasma IL-18 concentrations were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal involvement compared to CD patients with colonic disease.



 We identify IL-18 as a potential enhancer of both Th1-like and Th17-driven inflammation. High plasma IL-18 is detectable in subgroups of CD and UC patients, raising the question whether IL-18 acts on a specific disease-associated Thm cell population.

 The therapeutic goal in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn´s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is the control of the inflammatory process frequently through biologic and JAK-inhibitor therapies, which are generally expensive and may induce adverse effects. Unfortunately, only one-third of patients respond to these treatments, and there are no markers that accurately predict this response. The aim of this study was to identify potential serum and urinary metabolic biomarkers predictive of IBD response to different drugs at baseline (before treatment), which could facilitate the selection of the most appropriate therapy for each patient.



 A prospective multicenter study was conducted including CD and UC patients who initiated biologic (anti-TNF, ustekinumab or vedolizumab) or JAK-inhibitor (tofacitinib) therapies. Patients were assessed at 14 weeks to determine if they had achieved an endoscopic response, based on the SES-CD and on the endoscopic sub-score of the Partial Mayo Score. The analyses of the serum and urine metabolome, along with the deconvolution of the serum lipoprotein profile into 110 subfractions, were performed using nuclear magnetic resonance for a quantitative differential analysis comparing the baseline serum samples of responders and non-responders.



 A total of 150 patients were included (30 CD anti-TNF, 30 UC anti-TNF, 30 CD ustekinumab, 30 UC vedolizumab and 30 UC tofacitinib). Metabolomics analysis identified 55 potential predictive biomarkers of IBD treatment response (11 common and 44 drug-specific), with significantly altered levels (p<0.05) in the baseline urine and serum samples of subsequent responders compared to non-responders (Figure 1). Moreover, based on ROC curves, some of these biomarkers showed good sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between responders and non-responders before treatment (Figure 2). Finally, metabolite set enrichment analysis identified different biological pathways associated with the response to each of the treatments for IBD. Among the common ones, the citrate cycle and the metabolism of butanoate, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and arginine stood out.



 The present study represents a step towards personalized medicine in the selection of targeted therapies for IBD patients, addressing an important unmet need. Although further validation is needed, we have identified serum and urinary metabolic biomarkers with the potential to predict response to biologic and JAK-inhibitor therapies.

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Current immune-modulating therapies are insufficient for 30–50% of patients or cause significant side effects, emphasizing the need for new treatments. Targeting the innate immune system and enhancing drug delivery to inflamed gut regions are promising strategies. Neutrophils play a central role in IBD by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) —DNA-based structures with cytotoxic proteins—that contribute to mucosal damage and inflammation. Recent studies linking ROS production, DNA repair, and NET formation have identified NETs as potential therapeutic targets, with preclinical models showing positive outcomes from NET inhibition. Innovative oral drug delivery systems designed to target gut inflammation directly—without systemic absorption—could improve treatment precision and reduce side effects. Advanced formulations utilize properties such as particle size, surface modifications, and ROS-triggered release to selectively target the distal ileum and colon. A dual strategy that combines a deeper understanding of IBD pathophysiology to identify inflammation-related therapeutic targets with advanced drug delivery systems may offer significant promise. For instance, pairing NET inhibition with ROS-responsive nanocarriers could enhance treatment efficacy, though further research is needed. This synergistic approach has the potential to greatly improve outcomes for IBD patients.">

 Current biomarkers used to monitor the disease activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have several limitations in specificity and sensitivity, and there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers. Previously, Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) has been proven to protect against colitis by modulating the equilibrium of Notch signaling pathway. Therefore, we aimed to explore the possible value of serum GOLM1 in the clinical diagnosis and disease activity assessment of IBD.



 Collected clinical data, including serum GOLM1 and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, and Interleukin-6 [IL-6]), from 60 IBD patients (30 UC and 30 CD) and 30 control subjects (patients with colon polyps) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between August 2023 and August 2024. Mayo score and Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were used to evaluate the clinical disease activity of UC and CD, respectively. In UC, endoscopic disease activity was determined by the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), and in CD, it was measured by the Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD). The level of serum GOLM1 was compared between IBD and the control subjects, as well as among different subgroups of IBD patients. Analysed the correlations between serum GOLM1 level and inflammatory markers, and between serum GOLM1 level and disease activity indices.



 1. Serum GOLM1 levels were all elevated in IBD patients (p < 0.001), UC patients (p < 0.001), and CD patients (p = 0.050) compared with the control patients, and this trend was more pronounced in UC (Figure 1). Serum GOLM1 levels did not differentiate between UC and CD. Also, there was no significant difference in serum GOLM1 levels between remissive and active IBD patients, whether assessed clinically or endoscopically.
 2. The level of serum GOLM1 was positively correlated with ESR (r = 0.491, p < 0.001), CRP (r = 0.397, p = 0.002) and IL-6 (r = 0.493, p < 0.001) in IBD patients. The same trend was also observed in UC. Serum GOLM1 level was also positively correlated with UCEIS in endoscopically active UC patients (UCEIS ≥ 1) (r = 0.489, p = 0.048), but not with Mayo score in clinically active UC patients (Mayo ≥ 3) (Figure 2). In CD, serum GOLM1 level was only positively correlated with ESR (r = 0.437, p = 0.016) and IL-6 (r = 0.377, p = 0.040). In endoscopically active CD patients (SES-CD ≥ 3), serum GOLM1 level was not associated with SES-CD. Similarly, no association was found between serum GOLM1 level and CDAI in clinically active CD patients (CDAI ≥ 150).



 This study revealed a significant increase in the serum GOLM1 level in IBD, especially in UC. GOLM1 may be involved in the inflammatory process of IBD and may serve as a potential biomarker of IBD.

 Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are marked by dysregulated immune responses and significant T cell infiltration, leading to chronic intestinal inflammation. The global burden of IBD is increasing, yet its pathogenesis remains only partly understood. Our study aims to gain deeper insights into the immunological responsiveness of diseased tissue using ex vivo primary human intestinal tissue slices (Precision Cut Intestinal Slices; PCIS). PCIS are ultrathin tissue slices of the intestine of human donors that remain viable in culture, preserve intestinal architecture, and maintain all relevant intestinal cells including tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we specifically investigated the effects of the JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib and the calcineurin inhibitor pimecrolimus on tissue-resident immune cell responses in PCIS ex vivo.



 PCIS from ileum and colon resections of Crohn’s disease (CD) and non-CD patients were stimulated ex vivo with Concanavalin A, anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-1β. Induced responses were modulated with anti-inflammatory treatments such as pimecrolimus and filgotinib for 24h. We evaluated tissue viability (LDH-assay), cytokine release (multiplex ELISA), and PCIS morphology (H&E-staining and Immune fluorescence).



 CD and non-CD intestinal tissue slices maintained viability and intestinal morphology, including disease-specific features in ex vivo culture such as immune cell infiltrates and higher abundance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Ex vivo treatment with various immune stimulations revealed distinct disease-specific cytokine release patterns, with a primary focus on Th1 and Th17 responses, but also including other Th cell, innate and epithelial responses. Filgotinib (1-100 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the secretion of general proinflammatory and T cell-specific cytokines (maximal decrease e.g. IL-8: 8-fold, IL-6: 50-fold, IL-17A: 27-fold). Pimecrolimus (25 µM) specifically decreased T cell-specific cytokines (maximal decrease e.g. IL-2: 13-fold, IL-17A: 22-fold, IL-17F: 27-fold or IFNγ: 7-fold) while the release of general proinflammatory mediators like IL-8 was less affected.



 Our data show the anti-inflammatory effects of filgotinib and pimecrolimus in primary intestinal tissue slices ex vivo. These effects include modulation of various T cell-associated cytokines and other molecules involved in the calcineurin and JAK-STAT pathways. Notably, the different treatments showed distinct effects on cytokine release profiles. This study underscores the potential of PCIS to elucidate the mechanisms of JAK1 inhibitors, advancing IBD treatment strategies and providing a test platform for new drugs in a complex human tissue system.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), present ongoing challenges despite advances in pathophysiological understanding and therapeutic options. Current therapies often fail to achieve sustained remission, necessitating exploration of novel treatment targets.


AREAS COVERED
This review explores the role of Tumor Necrosis Factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) and its receptor DR3 in IBD pathogenesis, detailing their involvement in mucosal homeostasis and immune modulation. Recent studies on TL1A inhibitors highlight their potential in mitigating inflammation and fibrosis in IBD.


EXPERT OPINION
TL1A inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, supported by encouraging outcomes in clinical trials for moderate to severe IBD. Future research may elucidate TL1A's broader impact on immunity, epithelial integrity and fibrosis, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and biomarker discovery. Ongoing phase 3 trials are pivotal in assessing TL1A inhibitors as effective and safe treatments for IBD. Additionally, exploration of TL1A's role in fibrosis-associated complications and its potential as a biomarker for treatment response holds promise for personalized medicine approaches. Consideration of TL1A inhibition in concurrent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases suggests broader therapeutic implications beyond gastrointestinal manifestations of IBD.">

 Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) like Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic gastrointestinal disease with complex pathogenesis, leading to a lack of effective treatments. The efficacy of CU104, a new blocker of endothelial dysfunction,1 in other IBD models with a CD-like phenotype2 and its specific mechanism of action in colitis are still unknown.



 To evaluate the therapeutic potential of CU104, we induced colitis using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in IL-10 knockout mice3 and assessed its effectiveness. Additionally, we used Caco-2, HCT-116, and HT-29 cells to investigate its impact on intestinal barrier function, inflammatory signal pathway, actin dynamics,4 and gene expression through FITC-dextran permeability, trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), reporter gene, gene expression profiling, and immune assays.



 CU104 demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in DSS-induced colitis in IL-10 KO mice by potently suppressing innate immune activation, vascular and intestinal barrier dysfunction, and immune cell recruitment. Mechanistically, CU104 inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF),5 as well as the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) signaling pathways6 in vitro and in vivo, which play critical roles in maintaining barrier integrity and regulating immune cell recruitment during inflammation by regulating actin dynamics.



 Our findings suggest that CU104, a pseudo-sugar derivative of cholesterol that regulates actin dynamics and inflammatory signaling, could be a promising new treatment for CD along with UC.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy to maintain remission and improve quality of life. Despite the approval of numerous drugs, IBD continues to present treatment challenges. This review aims to summarize novel therapeutic target agents in phases II and III of development, including sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1P), anti-interleukin-23 (IL-23), and other small molecules and monoclonal antibodies currently under investigation (e.g., anti-TL1A, obefazimod, NX-13, RIPK-inhibitors). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to December 2024 to identify relevant articles published in English over the past three–five years, focusing on phase II/III studies for UC and CD. The search included databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and the ClinicalTrials.gov portal. Results: Clinical trials underline the potential of novel immunomodulators, including anti-TL1A, obefazimod, NX-13, RIPK inhibitors, and anti-IL-23p19 agents, as promising therapeutic options for IBD. Anti-IL23p19 therapies, such as risankizumab and mirikizumab, alongside guselkumab, exemplify this class’s growing clinical relevance. While some are already in clinical use, others are nearing approval. Conclusions: Ongoing research into long-term safety and the development of personalized treatment strategies remains pivotal to enhance outcomes. Patient stratification and the strategic positioning of these therapies within the expanding treatment landscape are critical for optimizing their clinical impact.">

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterized by the dysregulation of multiple factors, including host immunity. The intestinal activation of T cells showing cytotoxic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is one of the key factors in its pathology. Therefore, targeting pro-inflammatory leukocytes from the circulation and in the inflammatory site is a reasonable therapeutic goal. CCR9 is the main activator of gut-tropism in the lymphocytes and responsible for the activation of migratory responses in lymphocytes into the lamina propria.
 SBR1 is a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR9 mAb showing high-affinity and specific binding towards CCR9+ cells. Displaying effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), SRB1 shows specific depletion of infiltrating and circulating CCR9+ cells in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patient samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.



 Matching blood and 5 mm gut explants were obtained from IBD patients, then they were cultured for 16h with SRB1 and subsequently, CCR9+ cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants from these explants as well as blood samples from the same patients were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by Multiplex cytokine immune assay. Finally, in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) CCR9 cell depletion was determined by flow cytometric assays at doses of 8, 15 y 25 mg/kg.



 We showed that CCR9 is highly expressed in intestine samples from IBD patients, especially in T cells, but also in other cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Treatment with SRB1 was able to effectively deplete CCR9+ cells, specifically T CD4+ CCR9+ and CCR9+ memory T cells from blood and intestinal samples from IBD patients. This depletion also reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture media. Finally, SRB1 also showed efficacy depleting CCR9 in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) at different doses without showing any secondary adverse effects. All these data suggest a potential therapeutic potential of the antibody in the pathogenesis of IBD patients.



 SRB1 delivers potent blood and tissue depletion of CCR9 expressing cells ex vivo and in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patients’ samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SRB1 (anti-CCR9 mAb) a novel therapeutic approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases including CD and UC.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), comprised of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinicians and patients must vigilantly manage these complex diseases over the course of the patient's lifetime to mitigate risks of the disease, surgical complications, progression to neoplasia, and complications from medical or surgical therapies. Over the past several decades, the armamentarium of IBD therapeutics has expanded; now with biologics and advanced small molecules complementing conventional drugs such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and thiopurines. Significant attention has been paid to the potential of precision medicine to assist clinicians in tailoring therapeutics based on patients' genetic signatures to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse effects.


AREAS COVERED
In this paper, we review the published literature on genetic polymorphisms relevant to each class of IBD therapeutics.


EXPERT OPINION
Finally, we envision a paradigm shift in IBD research toward an omics-based network analysis approach. Through global collaboration, organization and goal setting, we predict the next decade of IBD research will revolutionize existing disease frameworks by developing precise molecular diagnoses, validated biomarkers, predictive models and novel molecularly targeted therapeutics.">

        <tr id="The persistent inflammation of the intestinal mucosa is the main characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a lifelong illness that affects people of both genders. The exact etiology is still undefined while previously it was attributed to genetic components. Later, it was investigated that the environment has an equal effect on the development of IBD encompassing both Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Among environmental risk factors linked to IBD, diet, notably the transition toward the Western diet, is the most noticeable element that contributes to IBD. This comprehensive overview summarizes the present literature on the role of food and food groups in IBD nutrition and management. Increased consumption of sugar, fats, and/or proteins, decreased consumption of fruits and vegetables, and increased use of emulsifiers or other binding compounds are among the most significant candidates that lead to inflammation in the intestines of healthy individuals. Furthermore, low dietary habits, including selective malnutrition, obesity, and sarcopenia, are linked with poor clinical results, treatment responsiveness, and, as a result, quality of life. Therefore, the trend in the management of IBD has shifted toward dietary therapies and strategies like Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), the Mediterranean diet (MD), Enteral Nutrition (EN), Crohn’s disease exclusion diet (CDED), Inflammatory bowel disease-Anti-inflammatory diet (IBD-AID), and others are reported to have had a positive association with reducing the underlying IBD symptoms and remission of intestinal homeostasis.">

 Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) characterised by chronic mucosal inflammation of the colon. It has been shown that fatigue in patients with ulcerative colitis is a particularly burdensome symptom[1]. Studies have shown that patients with IBD have higher fatigue scores than non-IBD control groups[1]. In UC, activation and dysregulation of the adaptive immune response at the epithelial level results in the abnormal response to antigens leading to an inflammatory cascade resulting in a production of multiple different pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL10, IL23 and TNF-α amongst others[2]. The aim of this study therefore is to evaluate the effects of a dual-strain probiotic versus placebo on cytokines in relation to UC and fatigue.



 This is a single centre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin. Participants are between the ages of 18 to 65 and have a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. After randomisation, participants were enrolled on either a 3 month probiotic or placebo arm. Participants had blood tests and a faecal calprotectin at baseline and at conclusion of the study. The probiotic is a dual strain Bifidobacterium longum 35624® combined with B. longum 1714®.



 10 controls and 59 participants meeting eligibility criteria were successfully recruited. After double-blind randomisation, 30 participants were on the active dual-probiotic arm with 29 participants on the placebo arm (table 1). In our cytokine analysis the mean concentrations for IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 increased post the probiotic. SAA and IL-17A remained relatively unchanged post the probiotic, and an improvement was seen in IL-1β and TNF-α. Contrasted with the placebo arm of the study where mean concentrations in IFN-γ, IL-17A, IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 increased post the placebo. SAA and IL-8 remained relatively unchanged post the placebo. There was an improvement seen in IFN-α, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-1β and TNF-α (table 2). Results could be due to low detection rates.



 This study found probiotics may not always be beneficial for patients with UC and may worsen some pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.

        <tr id="Chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) impose significant health burdens globally. IBDs, encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are multifactorial disorders characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, IBS is one of the principal gastrointestinal tract functional disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Although the precise etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unclear, mounting evidence suggests that non-coding RNA molecules play crucial roles in regulating gene expression associated with inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and tissue permeability, thus influencing disease progression. miRNAs have emerged as possible reliable biomarkers, as they can be analyzed in the biological fluids of patients at a low cost. This review explores the roles of miRNAs in IBDs and IBS, focusing on their involvement in the control of disease hallmarks. By an extensive literature review and employing bioinformatics tools, we identified the miRNAs frequently studied concerning these diseases. Ultimately, specific miRNAs could be proposed as diagnostic biomarkers for IBDs and IBS. Their ability to be secreted into biofluids makes them promising candidates for non-invasive diagnostic tools. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms through the ways in which they regulate gastrointestinal inflammation and immune responses could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of IBDs and IBS and open avenues for miRNA-based therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Despite the increasing number of available medications, a significant proportion of IBD patients fail to achieve the current therapeutic targets. Uncontrolled IBD has a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and on overall costs for the healthcare system. Given the complex pathophysiology of IBD, Combined Advanced Targeted Therapy (CATT), involving the combination of biologics/small molecules, appears to have biological plausibility and is gaining increasing interest. The aim of this narrative review is to provide the current evidence regarding CATT in IBD and propose future developments in this field. Methods: Relevant literature evidence was searched with pertinent MeSH terms in the most important database. Results: Available evidence of CATT in IBD provides encouraging results in terms of efficacy and effectiveness, with an acceptable safety profile. CATT may represent a therapeutic solution for patients with “difficult-to-treat” IBD or with concomitant immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, current data are restricted by an overall low level of evidence and by the short follow-up. Conclusions: There are no data concluding the superiority of one combination therapy over another. Various therapeutic schemes could be applied in the near future. Further studies are needed to provide recommendations and integrate this therapeutic strategy into everyday clinical practice.">

 B cells and their secreted immunoglobulin A (IgA) play an increasingly recognised role in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) therapy. While plasma IgA levels have been shown to be elevated in IBD patients compared to healthy controls and decrease with biologic therapy1, its relationship with clinical parameters and therapeutic outcomes remains unclear. Cytokines such as interleukin-21 (IL-21), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) are known to regulate B-cell activity in IBD2, but their role in IgA secretion requires further investigation. This study aimed to explore these relationships and identify key cytokines regulating IgA secretion.



 We enrolled 43 patients with IBD (31 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 with Crohn’s disease (CD)) between 2022 to 2024. Plasma levels of IgA, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (HCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, calcium, and ferritin were measured at baseline for all patients and at week 14 for patients receiving biological therapy (adalimumab or vedolizumab, n=16). Clinical response was defined as a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <150 for CD patients or a ≥2-point reduction in the partial Mayo score for UC patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t-test and linear regression. Additionally, the DAKIKI cell line was used to assess which cytokines influence IgA secretion.



 Plasma IgA levels significantly decreased at week 14 in most patients receiving biologic therapy (P = 0.0022) (Figure 1A), irrespective of clinical response. However, patients who did not achieve clinical response had significantly higher baseline IgA levels compared to those who did achieve (3057±217.2 vs 1880±214.1 μg/mL, P = 0.0032) (Figure 1B). In all patients, plasma IgA levels showed positive correlations with HCT and ESR, and a negative correlation with ferritin level. Notably, these correlations were stronger in CD patients, where IgA levels showed more significant associations with Hb (R² = 0.2754, P = 0.0369), ESR (R² = 0.3938, P = 0.0123), CRP (R² = 0.3003, P = 0.028), and CDAI (R² = 0.5739, P = 0.0017). In vitro, IL-21 and IL-6 both stimulated IgA secretion in DAKIKI cells, with IL-21 demonstrating greater potency (Figure 2).



 Plasma IgA levels are correlated with disease activity and clinical parameters, particularly in patients with CD, and may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring therapeutic response. Baseline IgA levels may predictive clinical response at week 14. Additionally, IL-21 appears to be a key cytokine driving IgA secretion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in IBD management.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a long-term condition characterized by inflammation of the gut. Research has shown that disruption of the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, plays an important role in the disease. While current treatments focus on controlling inflammation, many patients continue to experience symptoms or side effects. This study explores the effectiveness of a new therapy aimed at restoring the balance of gut microbes and improving disease outcomes.



 This study included 120 adults with IBD, randomly divided into two groups: one received standard care, and the other received a combination of prebiotics, probiotics, and dietary adjustments targeting gut bacteria. The trial lasted 12 weeks, with assessments at the start, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Prognosis was assessed through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and colonoscopy to evaluate disease extent, detect complications, and monitor gastrointestinal changes. Postoperative complications, clinical symptoms, and routine lab tests (CRP and IL-6) were used to assess outcomes. Statistical tests compared clinical and endoscopic results between the groups.



 Patients who received the microbiota-targeted therapy showed significant improvement compared to the standard care group. Disease scores decreased notably (Harvey-Bradshaw Index reduced by 3.9 points and Mayo Score by 3.2 points, both p < 0.01). Blood markers of inflammation also dropped, with CRP levels falling by 42% and IL-6 by 38% (both p < 0.05).Additionally, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and colonoscopy were used to assess the condition of the gastrointestinal tract and evaluate disease improvement. Postoperative complications, changes in clinical symptoms, and routine test results also helped in determining the treatment outcome. The therapy was well tolerated by patients, with no major side effects reported.



 This study highlights the promising potential of gut microbiota therapy as a safe and effective approach for improving symptoms and reducing inflammation in IBD. By restoring balance to the gut microbiota, this therapy targets a critical factor in the disease process. The positive outcomes observed in this trial pave the way for future research into the integration of microbiota-based treatments as part of comprehensive IBD management strategies. Continued investigation in larger, long-term studies will be crucial to further validate these findings and explore the potential of microbiota-targeted therapies for achieving sustained remission and improving overall patient outcomes.

 Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) display heterogenous responses to different treatment modalities suggesting distinct disease pathomechanisms. Herein, tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is associated with a range of chronic inflammatory disease, but the relevance to guide treatment decision in IBD remains unclear. Here, we sought to evaluate Trp serum level as a biomarker of treatment response in IBD in comparison to established disease biomarkers.



 We analyzed and compared the serum levels of Trp and C-reactive protein (CRP) from patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) (n = 15) and Crohns Disease (CD) (n = 10). Longitudinal analyses of 100 serum Trp measurements were obtained and associated with inflammatory IBD markers during the induction period of various biological agents including TNF-α inhibitors (n=2), interleukin inhibitors (n=11), JAK inhibitors (n= 8), Sphingosine modulators (n=3) and integrin inhibitors (n=1).



 As expected, we found an inverse correlation between CRP and Trp (rs = -0.219, p = 0.045), indication a weak, negative correlation between the two variables across all patients. However, while this effect was predominantly observed in UC (r = - 0.317, p = 0.003), patients with CD showed no significant correlation between CRP and Trp levels (rs = -0.082, p = 0.763). In line with these findings, the observed correlation showed significant correlation in the different treatment modalities. Patients who received either interleukin- or JAK inhibitors displayed a stronger correlation (rs = -0.542, p = 0.001 and rs = - 0.358, p = 0.007 respectively), while patients receiving TNF-α-/ integrin inhibitors or Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators did not show a significant correlation.



 Highlighting the heterogeneity of responses to different biologics, we observed a correlation between high serum Trp levels and a decline in biomarkers associated with a disease flare. These observations were most pronounced in patients with UC receiving treatment with interleukin- and JAK inhibitors suggesting potential therapeutic relevance in indicating early signs of successful induction treatment.

 Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic inflammation of the intestinal tissue and persistent disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. A common and dangerous complication of chronic inflammation during IBD is fibrosis, a mechanical stiffening of the intestinal tissue [1,2]. Previous work suggests that immune cell activity, for example Interleukin (IL)-13-mediated macrophage activation, can be mechanosensitive [3,4]. However, it is not currently well understood how fibrosis affects the inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells.



 To address how tissue stiffness impacts intestinal inflammation, we studied the effects of inflammatory cytokine signaling in intestinal epithelial cells using a recently developed intestinal organoid monolayer model. We cultured intestinal organoid monolayers on soft (0.5kPa), intermediate (5kPa) or stiff (15kPa) hydrogels to mimic physiological or fibrotic conditions and studied the cellular response to IL-13, an inflammatory cytokine implicated in IBD and loss of barrier integrity. To investigate the impacts of substrate stiffness and IL-13 signaling on epithelial cell function, we combined high-resolution live microscopy, quantitative image analysis using AI-based models and biophysical measurements.



 We found that substrate mechanosensing and IL-13 signaling interact synergistically to modulate intestinal epithelial stem cell differentiation, leading to a dramatic increase in the frequency of secretory cells. Furthermore, organoids cultured on stiff substrates no longer respond to IL-13 treatment, suggesting that fibrotic conditions may promote an inflamed-like state even in the absence of inflammatory cytokines. To further investigate cross-talk between substrate mechanics and IL-13 signalling, we inhibited downstream IL-13 signalling and cell contractility. We found that both the stiffness- and IL-13-induced phenotypes could be rescued by either inhibiting myosin-2 activity or blocking downstream IL-13 signalling, further indicating a co-dependence and synergy of substrate stiffness and IL-13. Further experiments implicate the relocalization of myosin-2 to the cell cortex and increased nuclear accumulation of the mechanosensitive protein YAP in mediating this response. Experiments using mouse models of colitis further support a role for YAP in this process.



 Taken together, this work reveals how tissue mechanics modulate the inflammatory response in the intestinal epithelium. Future translational work based on these findings will inspire new approaches to mitigate the effects of fibrosis during IBD.

 The signaling networks perpetuating chronic inflammatory bowel disease remain unclear. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) has been previously reported to trigger the expansion of effector Th17 cells and anti-IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) antagonism to render IL23-differentiated Th17 cells susceptible to apoptosis1. We previously reported that IL-7R pathway is locally dysregulated and over-expressed in the colon mucosa of severe IBD patients and reproducibly associated with unresponsiveness to anti-TNF or anti-α4β7 integrin therapies2. We developed a humanized anti-IL7R lusvertikimab with a good PK/PD and tolerance profile in healthy volunteers3 and recently announced positive phase 2 efficacy results in ulcerative colitis after a 10 week-induction treatment period (randomized placebo-controlled CoTikiS study: NCT04882007).



 Here, we investigated at preclinical level the additive effect of blocking IL-7R in combination with anti-IL12/23 antagonist antibody in an anti-TNF refractory adoptive T cell transfer chronic colitis mouse model as well as in-vitro on human Th17 cell differentiation in combination with anti-IL23 antibody.



 T cell-recipient mice developed a colitis characterised by the development of diarrhoea and body weight loss with post-mortem examination confirming epithelial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration into the mucosa. Anti-IL7R monotherapy at this dose was suboptimal in this model. Anti-IL-12/23 blockade in monotherapy was efficient but not enough alone to achieve complete remission at macroscopic and histological level. In contrast, administration of anti-IL-7R in combination with anti-IL12/23 mAb was associated with a strong and significant reduction in all measured colitis symptoms, macroscopic large bowel changes and all histopathological endpoints (hyperplasia, colitis severity, inflammation). When mice were treated in combination, the group was statistically different from the anti-IL12/23 monotherapy group and no statistical difference have been measured with the non-colitis group, illustrating this combination achieved complete remission including at histological mucosal healing. In vitro, we confirmed that IL-7 drives human Th17 differentiation despite IL23 blockade and that combining IL7R and IL23 blockade was efficient to prevent Th17 generation in the presence of both IL7 and IL23.



 Our findings show that anti-IL-7R is well tolerated in combination with anti-IL12/23 mAb in mice and act in synergy to achieve a profound control of chronic colitis and complete histological normalization compared to monotherapy.

        <tr id="Irritable bowel disease (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a persistent and recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Despite the increasing prevalence of IBD globally, its precise aetiology remains unidentified, and no definitive treatment or cure has been established. The intricate interplay among environmental influences, genetics, and the host's immune system is believed to be the primary aetiology of IBD. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies indicate that IBD is linked to alterations in the function and composition of the gut microbiota, called dysbiosis. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that dysbiosis plays a crucial part in the onset of IBD. Despite extensive investigations aimed at identifying new pathogenic factors related to IBD, encompassing environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune response elements, a comprehensive knowledge of IBD aetiology still needs to be identified as the treatment for IBD patients requires improved outcomes. A more profound comprehension of the disease's aetiology may yield distinctive insights applicable to developing therapeutic strategies for IBD. Recent research has markedly enhanced our understanding of the pathobiology of IBD, resulting in substantial progress in its diagnosis and treatment. We have emphasized current advancements and discoveries about emerging elements that contribute to disease pathogenesis, such as gut microbiota, which significantly influence the aetiology of IBD and may serve as prospective targets for innovative therapeutics in IBD patients.">

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal condition characterized by immune dysregulation driven by microbiome dysbiosis, with a reduction of beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, a dominant commensal bacterium comprising 5-10% of the human gut microbiome. Its depletion is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and other autoimmune-related conditions, making it an emerging candidate as a next-generation probiotic.



 CJRB-201 was selected using our BI platform (Ez-Mx), based on more than 500 metagenomic datasets from IBD patients and healthy controls. The immune regulatory efficacy of CJRB-201 was evaluated through in vitro and ex vivo assays, focusing on key cytokine ratios (IL-10/IL-1β, IL-10/TNF, IL-10/IFN-γ) in macrophages and T cells. The induction of T regulatory (T reg) cell populations was evaluated ex vivo and in germ-free (GF) mice. Three pathogenetically different IBD animal models (DSS-induced, IL-10 KO GF, T cell transfer) were examined to assess its efficacy. Lastly, the SHIME system (Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem) was applied to test various fibers that promote the growth of CJRB-201.



 Among 34 tested anti-inflammatory strains, including those from CJ Bioscience, 4D Pharma, and our Ez-Mx platform, CJRB-201 emerged as one of the most effective. Notably, CJRB-201 and its conforming species showed the highest induction of T reg populations ex vivo among the sixty Faecalibacterium strains, primarily driven by its cell pellet form rather than the supernatant. Administration of CJRB-201 resulted in successful colonization in the colon of GF mice, leading to an enhanced T reg cell population. In the three IBD models with both preventative and therapeutic approaches, CJRB-201 demonstrated significant improvements across five key disease features (body weight, disease activity index, colon length, histopathology, and inflammatory markers such as cytokines and fecal lipocalin-2). Interestingly, CJRB-201 outperformed other potential single and consortia strains and demonstrated efficacy comparable to the α-IL-12p40 antibody, particularly in the T cell transfer model (Figure 1). Lastly, we identified the fiber that stabilizes the engraftment of CJRB-201 in the SHIME system.



 CJRB-201 exhibits superior anti-inflammatory efficacy in multiple immune assays and IBD animal models, significantly improving preclinical and inflammatory markers. Given its ability to enhance T reg populations and the promising potential of the identified fiber in supporting its colonization, CJRB-201 holds strong promise as a microbiome-based therapeutic for IBD patients.

 Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are complex conditions characterized by significant clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbiological heterogeneity. Current therapeutic strategies, particularly biologics and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, are effective for inducing clinical remission and controlling inflammation. However, one-third of patients fail to respond to these treatments, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to better tailor therapy and improve outcomes.



 In this study, we conducted a multi-omic approach, integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics to identify biomarkers of treatment response in IBD. A cohort of 57 active CD and 70 active UC patients was analyzed before and after 14 weeks of treatment with anti-TNF, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, or tofacitinib. Response was evaluated using endoscopic criteria, categorizing patients as responders or non-responders. Biological samples [serum, urine, serum extracellular vesicles (EVs), intestinal biopsies, and stool] were analysed using RNA sequencing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess molecular and microbial profiles.



 Our results identified multiple mRNAs, proteins and metabolites associated with treatment response (Table 1). Gene expression analysis in intestinal tissue showed significant differences between UC patients responders and non-responders to vedolizumab. Proteomic analysis of serum EVs and intestinal tissue samples revealed differentially expressed proteins between different study groups. Metabolomic analysis identified deregulation of 24 serum lipoproteins from CD responders to ustekinumab compared to non-responders. Pathway analysis highlighted significant enrichment in ketone and butyrate metabolism, mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, carnitine synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Metagenomic analysis revealed microbial differences in UC patients responders to anti-TNF therapy compared to non-responders (Figure 1).



 This multi-omics analysis uncovers promising biomarkers that could serve as predictive indicators of therapeutic response to biologics and JAK inhibitors. Nevertheless, further studies are crucial to confirm these findings and evaluate their clinical relevance in identifying patients most likely to respond to tailored therapeutic interventions. One of the challenges is integrating results from different omics approaches to create a more holistic understanding of the disease, potentially opening doors for more precise/early detection through multipanel biomarkers.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis is a common preclinical mouse model in IBD research. DSS colitis involves activation of the submucosal immune system and can be used to study Ulcerative Colitis characteristics in different phases (acute, chronic and remission) and predict compound efficacy. However, optimizing translation to human is still needed and the use of mice with Human Immune System (HIS) provide a better model to study human immune system responses in vivo. HIS mice are created by transplanting human immune cells or their progenitor cells into highly immunodeficient recipient mouse hosts, thereby "humanizing" their immune systems. In this study we discussed colitis feature and the use of humanized mice model for testing therapeutics in preclinical studies



 15-weeks-old female HIS mice were treated with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (ad.lib.) for 5 days to induce acute colitis. Colonic and systemic human cytokines were assessed by MSD plex assay. Human immune cell infiltration into the colon was measured by flow cytometry. Colonic histological damage was assessed on colon Swiss roll after H&E staining



 HIS mice challenged with DSS exhibited body weight loss and increase disease activity index (loose stool or diarrhea, rectal bleeding) compared to naive HIS mice. HIS-DSS mice show a strong human pro-inflammatory response, including elevated hIL-1B, hTNF, hIL-6 in plasma and colon as well as specific human cytokines (MCP-4, IL-8, IL-26, IL-37…). Colon microscopic analysis show loss of goblet cells, loss of crypt structure and increase of inflammatory cell infiltration at the level of mucosa and submucosa



 These data show a significant increase of human pro-inflammatory cytokines after DSS intake as well as histologic score characteristic of Ulcerative Colitis. They also confirm that HIS mice represent a relevant model for the preclinical assessment of therapeutics in IBD.

 Vedolizumab is effective for moderate-severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC), but predictive markers for long-term response are limited. This study aimed to profile circulating cytokines linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathophysiology to identify immune predictive markers of vedolizumab response in UC patients. Secondary objectives included analyzing associations between baseline characteristics—such as smoking, disease duration, prior biologic exposure, and initial faecal calprotectin (FCP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels—and treatment response.



 This retrospective, single-centre cohort study included 28 UC patients with inflammation objectified by clinical and biochemical data who initiated vedolizumab from 2015 to 2022. Blood samples were collected before treatment, and responses were evaluated at follow-up. Clinical remission (pMAYO < 3 with no subscore >1) with biochemical response (≥50% reduction in FCP and/or CRP) defined positive response. Endoscopic response was assessed in patients with available colonoscopy (endoscopic Mayo 0-1). Cytokines were measured via Magpix® Luminex with a Milliplex® T Cell Magnetic Bead Panel including 13 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL8, IL12, IL13, IL17A, IL10, IL2, IL21, IL23, IL7, TNF-alpha, IL6, IL-1β).



 Twenty-eight patients with UC (100% pancolitis or left colitis) and S2+S3 94.7% were included in the study. 85.2% werebioexposed (infliximab in 75%). 50% of patients received concomitant corticosteroid therapy at the start of vedolizumab. Vedolizumab response was seen in 13 patients (46.4%) after a median overall treatment duration in both cohorts of 2.79 years (IQR7.55). The responder group was on vedolizumab treatment for a median of 5.58 (IQR 6.9) years vs 1.17 (IQR 5.13) years in the nonrespondergroup, p=0.005.
 There were no baseline differences between responders in pMayo or in FCP and CRP values. Activesmoking, disease duration until vedolizumab initiation and previous exposure to other biologics were not associated withresponse/non-response to vedolizumab treatment.
 Vedolizumab responders had significantly lower median interleukin 8 (IL8) levels at baseline than vedolizumab non-responders(median IL8 1.67 pg/mL versus 3.03 pg/mL, p=0.016). No statistically significant differences in baseline concentrations were found inany of the other interleukins analysed.



 In our series of UC patients treated with vedolizumab, patients with long-term response to the drug show lower plasma IL8 levels than non-responders at baseline. Therefore, IL8 could serve as a predictive marker of long-term response to vedolizumab inUC patients. These results should be confirmed in prospective studies with larger sample sizes.

 Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic gastrointestinal disorders with rising prevalence in Asia. Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting α4β7 integrin, selectively blocking gut lymphocyte trafficking. Despite numerous real-world studies on VDZ use in Asian patients with IBD over recent years, a comprehensive analysis summarizing its effectiveness and safety is still lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VDZ in Asian patients with IBD.



 A literature search was conducted to identify real-world studies evaluating intravenous VDZ in Asian patients with IBD from inception to 20th December 2023. Meta-analyses were performed separately for CD and UC patients to pool clinical and endoscopic remission and response rates across induction (6-14 weeks), medium term (22-30 weeks), and long term (over 48 or 52 weeks) using a random-effects model in R software. The incidence of adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE), and serious infection were assessed for safety.



 Twenty-nine studies (15 CD and 25 UC) with 2,395 patients (827 CD, 1,568 UC) were analysed (Figure 1). In the induction phase, clinical response and remission were achieved in 57.48% and 61.15% of CD patients, and 64.72% and 40.07% of UC patients. In the medium term, clinical response and remission were 64.32% and 60.72% for CD, and 64.87% and 43.51% for UC. In the long term, the clinical response and clinical remission rate were 44.55% and 45.83% in CD patients, 61.35% and 56.14% in UC patients. Moreover, corticosteroid-free clinical remission was achieved by 36.58% of that in CD and 49.03% of that in UC for the long-term observation.
 Endoscopic response was achieved by 41.37% of CD patients and 48.57% of UC patients during induction phase. Endoscopic remission rates for CD were 11.11%, 18.41%, and 36.42%, and for UC 43.19%, 54.27%, and 66.72% in induction, medium, and long term, respectively. The pooled complete endoscopic remission rates for UC were 27.98% (induction), 47.87% (medium term), and 50.61% (long term) (Table 1).
 AEs occurred in 6.67% to 61.54% of CD patients and 29.69% to 75.38% of UC patients. SAEs and serious infection rates were 0.00% to 1.56% and 0.00% to 2.70% in UC patients, and 0.00% to 0.75% for serious infections in CD, with no SAEs reported in CD studies.



 VDZ demonstrated effective clinical outcomes with a favourable safety profile in Asian patients with IBD.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cause chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory flares in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gut dysmotility in non-destructive collagenous and lymphocytic microscopic colitis. In addition, classic IBDs Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis cause bloody diarrhea and extraintestinal symptoms. Non-destructive IBDs seem to restrain an overt immune response that will damage the tissue and impair wound healing. Thus, I will work under the premise that non-destructive IBDs are undeveloped forms of classic IBDs.



 First, I aim to deeply characterize and compare immune cells and their activation levels in all forms of IBD using “immunomics” (spectral/computational cytometry) and validate my previous finding of two subtypes of lymphocytic colitis. To identify the microbiota that adheres to intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) and therefore alter permeability, and induce collagen deposition, I will coculture IEC and fibroblasts in organ-on-a-chip platforms to mimic gut conditions, including microflow shear stress. I will stimulate chips with patient-derived microbiota-containing luminal content or homogenized biopsies and resections from collagenous colitis (characterized by pathogenic collagen position) and intestinal fibrosis (a major, irreversible IBD complication that increases mortality), respectively, and study using different sequencing techniques. Of note, collagenous colitis could resemble early stages of intestinal fibrosis. My third objective aims to test my previous observation that regulatory B-cells in collagenous colitis might be responsible of restricting overt inflammation.



 I will adapt spectral cytometry panels to characterize the state of mucosal B- and plasma cells. The support of my host, the well-established IBD immunologist Assoc. Prof. David Bernardo at the Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Genetics (Valladolid, Spain, h-index=33) and me as coordinator of the biobank for the European Microscopic Colitis Group, ensure the feasibility to complete my ambitious research agenda and make a great impact on IBD field to discover disease-specific biomarkers, pathomechanisms, and new druggable targets.

        <tr id="Simple Summary The interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) is a crucial regulatory element of the immune system with profound implications for human health. Signaling downstream of IL-23R polarizes and directs a broad spectrum of lymphocyte populations, particularly CD4+ subsets such as Th17 and Treg, thereby influencing the pro- or anti-inflammatory roles of these cells. The clinical relevance of IL-23R is considerable, with variants in this gene having been associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the emerging role of IL-23R in carcinogenesis is worthy of note. Several variants in the IL-23R gene have been identified as predisposing factors in the development of disparate types of cancer in different populations, while other variants appear to be protective factors. A comprehensive grasp of the mechanisms underlying the IL-23/IL-23R pathway and the capacity to modulate it represent indispensable prerequisites for the formulation of novel therapeutics for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders and cancer. This knowledge promises the emergence of more efficacious and personalized interventions.">

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs), key regulators of gene expression, are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to their roles in immune response and tissue integrity. This study explores miRNA roles in IBD, focusing on Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis and potential therapies. We analyzed epithelial cell-derived miRNA expression in CD patients versus healthy controls and investigated how these miRNAs modulate inflammation in experimental IBD models.



 Terminal ileum samples were prospectively collected via ileocolonoscopy from non-IBD healthy controls (n=26), CD patients in remission (n=34), and active CD patients (n=42). Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score below 150 with endoscopic mucosal healing. For active CD cases, samples were taken from inflamed and non-inflamed regions. miRNA levels were quantified by small-RNA sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR. Based on these results, specific miRNAs were selected, and single-stranded mimics were administered in a 2.5% DSS-induced colitis model to evaluate their effects. Histological grading, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and microbiome analysis using mouse fecal samples were performed.



 Small-RNA sequencing revealed distinct miRNA expression patterns in CD patients, both in remission and in active states (including inflamed and non-inflamed tissues), compared to healthy controls. qRT-PCR validation showed significantly reduced expression of miR-141-3p, miR-338-3p, miR-378a-3p, and miR-200b-3p, along with significantly increased levels of miR-125b-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-155-5p in inflamed tissue of active CD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated diagnostic potential for these miRNAs in relation to disease activity and endoscopic inflammation. In a DSS-induced colitis mouse model, miR-338-3p and miR-378a-3p showed anti-inflammatory effects, reducing body weight loss, colon inflammation, and immune cell markers. Target analyses identified MACC1 and IL-33 as key mRNA targets. Immunohistochemistry indicated an IL-33 pathway-dependent anti-inflammatory response via miR-378-3p, while miR-338-3p appeared to regulate gut inflammation by targeting MACC1 gene expression. In vitro analyses revealed that IL-33 activates MACC1, a process also reduced by miR-378a-3p treatment. Fecal microbiome analysis identified several bacterial species including Akkermansia muciniphilia and certain Bacteroides, associated with beneficial effects in the groups treated with both miRNA mimics.



 This study identifies miR-338-3p and miR-378a-3p as modulators of inflammation in an IL-33-dependent manner in CD patients, underscoring their potential as promising targets for treatment of CD.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic multifactorial gastrointestinal condition influenced by genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Gut microbiota disruption plays a key role in disease onset and progression, leading to inflammation, impaired healing, and increased intestinal permeability1,2. Diet, particularly polyphenols from fruits, vegetables, and tea, can impact microbiota composition and offer anti-inflammatory benefits. This study explores the effects of these compounds on inflammation of the intestinal epithelium at the transcriptomic level.



 A panel of polyphenolic compounds (n=8) was tested on Caco-2 cells, which were pre-treated with the metabolites before inflammation was induced for 24 h using TNF-α and IFN-γ. The effects were evaluated through targeted gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR. Prioritized compounds – Urolithin A (UroA) and Gallic Acid (GA) – were further tested on inflamed 3D colonic epithelial organoids derived from ulcerative colitis patient (UC) (n=1) and non-IBD individual (n=1), with mRNA sequencing performed on the NextSeq 550 (Illumina).



 Initial metabolite screening in Caco-2 cells was performed by analyzing the expression changes of pro-inflammatory cytokines-coding genes TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-8. Results demonstrated significant induction of cellular inflammation (p < 0.05) after exogenous stimullation with TNF-α and IFN-γ, which was most efficiently and consistenly reduced by GA and UroA. Therefore, GA and UroA were further selected for deeper evaluation on inflamed colonic epithelial organoids. RNA-seq revealed more pronounced cell reactivity to all treatments in UC-organoids compared to non-IBD-organoids and clear sample clustering based on treatment condition. DEA and GSEA of significantly dysregulated genes revealed interesting functional insights into potential mechanisms of action of UroA and GA. Importanly, in inflammed UC-organoids, pre-treatment with GA showed significant (FDR < 0.05) upregulation of pathways involved in cell junction assembly, and significant (FDR < 0.05) downregulation of pathways involved in metabolic processes. Together, these results suggest that GA may lead to colonic epithelial cell metabolic reprogramming in UC from energy-intensive and nucleotide-demanding processess and contribute to the resolution of inflammation and restoration of gut epithelial integrity.



 In conclusion, during colonic inflammation, dietary polyphenol metabolites regulate inflammatory responses, epithelial barrier function, and energy production pathways at the transcriptomic level.

 Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is crucial in IBD pathogenesis: previous studies showed that its expression correlates to the degree of colonic inflammation and that its issue levels may predict response to biologic agents. This project addresses immunohistochemical (IHC) TNF-alpha expression profiles and patterns in ileal, colonic, and rectal biopsies before and after biologic therapy, matched with endoscopic and clinical severity indexes. Thus, this study aims to identiy possible histological and IHC markers predictive of drug response.



 A cohort of ten patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (7 Crohn’s Disease and 3 Ulcerative Colitis) treated with biologic agents were phenotypically defined according to the Montreal classification and retrospectively characterized as responders or non- responders. These features were pioneeringly integrated with IHC quantiying TNF-alpha positivity and endoscopic severity scores (SES-CD, Mayo endoscopic subscore) aHer the collection of colonoscopy biopsy specimens. IHC TNF-alpha assessment evidenced pronounced cytoplasmic staining of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria amidst crypts and occasionally with a transmural distribution. Elevated TNF-alpha positive cells (arbitrary cut-off of ≥ 20) were chiefly observed at diagnosis or relapse in the intestinal segments affected by the disease.



 For each colonoscopy, endoscopic activity (SES-CD/Mayoendoscopic score) significantly correlated with the dichotomic number of TNF-alpha+ cells measured in the biopsies at the endoscopic (ESOD) and histologic (HSOD) site of disease (p=0,039; p=0,046). Furthermore, the number of TNF-alpha positive cells in the HSOD segment at the first check-up available during treatment was significantly associated with response to first-line biologics (p= 0,023), thus suggest whether treatment continuation was appropriate or not.



 This study thoroughly examines the link between IHC investigation of TNF-alpha positivity, Montreal classification at diagnosis, and endoscopic activity indexes. TNF-alpha IHC analysis could further stratify IBD patients and increase diagnostic accuracy, securing a patent- and disease-tailored therapy and avoiding unnecessary and ineffective treatments. As an outcome, it could reduce fruitless health expenditures resulting from failed therapeutic attempts. Lastly, this evaluation could spark new possibilities for molecular biology research regarding TNF-alpha functionality on the ileocolon and further elucidate the mechanisms underlying IBD.

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are complex chronic disorders characterized by an intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, gut microbiota alterations, and environmental exposures. This review aims to synthesize recent advances in IBD pathogenesis, exploring key mechanisms and potential avenues for prevention and personalized therapy. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major bibliographic databases, selecting the most recent and impactful studies on IBD pathogenesis. The review integrates findings from multi-omics analyses, single-cell transcriptomics, and longitudinal cohort studies, focusing on immune regulation, gut microbiota dynamics, and environmental factors influencing disease onset and progression. Immune dysregulation, including macrophage polarization (M1 vs. M2) and Th17 activation, emerges as a cornerstone of IBD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis, as a result of reduced alpha and beta diversity and overgrowth of harmful taxa, is one of the main contributing factors in causing inflammation in IBD. Environmental factors, including air and water pollutants, maternal smoking, and antibiotic exposure during pregnancy and infancy, significantly modulate IBD risk through epigenetic and microbiota-mediated mechanisms. While recent advances have supported the development of new therapeutic strategies, deeply understanding the complex dynamics of IBD pathogenesis remains challenging. Future efforts should aim to reduce the burden of disease with precise, personalized treatments and lower the incidence of IBD through early-life prevention and targeted interventions addressing modifiable risk factors.">

 While treatment options for active disease in IBD become diverse, the choice of therapies is mostly based on patient characteristics, disease course and severity but restrained by economic rationales. To maximize treatment effectiveness, predictive biomarkers are needed to guide therapies either ex ante or at the earliest possible time point after therapy initiation. Previously, we identified dynamic blood-based RNA and DNA methylation signatures that are linked with therapy response to anti-TNF in IBD1. Here, we aim to identify serum proteome biomarkers associated with therapeutic outcomes in IBD patients receiving anti-TNF treatment.



 31 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 27 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients with active clinical and endoscopic disease were recruited and followed at baseline (W0) and at weeks 2 (W2), 6 (W6), and 14 (W14) after initiating infliximab therapy. The clinical endpoint of interest was defined as a combination of clinical remission (partial Mayo ≤ 2/CDAI < 150) and endoscopic response (reduction in endoscopic Mayo ≥ 1/SES-CD ≥ 50%) at W14. Serum was collected at each time point and subjected to proximity extension assays (Olink® Explore 3072 panel) to screen for 2,944 proteins. Linear mixed models (LMM) were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between endpoint achievers/non-achievers over time. Additionally, post-analysis of DEPs was performed using cv.glmnet with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify candidate predictive marker sets.



 A total of 229 DEPs were identified over time between UC responders and non-responders: 8 at W0, 22 at W2, 181 at W6, and 78 at W14. In CD patients, 23 DEPs were identified: 9 at W0, 7 at W2, 13 at W6, and 13 at W14. These DEPs were disease-specific and linked to Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to inflammatory response and cell differentiation. Using LMM and machine learning, we identified 5 baseline proteins in UC and 6 in CD patients that differentiated combined endpoint achievers from non-achievers (AUROC: UC: 0.958, CD: 0.800). Additionally, we identified dynamic changes from W0 to W2 in 7 proteins associated with immune regulation in UC patients (1 in CD), which were linked to therapeutic outcomes at W14.



 Detecting specific ex ante biomarkers or early dynamic molecular signatures are critical for precision medicine in IBD. Our data suggest that serum proteomics profiling enables the differentiation of patients who will attain therapeutic success under anti-TNF therapy from those who will not. This study warrants further investigations in larger, independent datasets to confirm the potential clinical utility of the proteomics signature.

 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. A significant portion of patients also experience extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) that involve various organ systems beyond the intestines. EIMs are often present at the onset of disease or may develop later during the course of IBD, and their severity can vary, influencing overall disease prognosis and quality of life. Effective management of IBD requires a holistic approach that not only addresses the intestinal inflammation but also anticipates and treats these extra-intestinal complications.
 In this study we aimed to investigate the role of EIM presence on anti-TNF treatment persistence in IBD therapy.



 This was a single center, retrospective cohort analysis of patients with IBD either received adalimumab or infliximab as a first line biologic treatment. A total of 673 patients were included to this analysis. Demographic information such as gender, age, Montreal classification, EIM presence, smoking and prior medications were noted from patients electronic medical records. Weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were used to assess the outcomes.



 Out of 673 patients, 426 patients had Crohn’s disease, 240 patients had ulcerative colitis and 7 patients had indeterminate colitis. Overall, 379 pateints received adalimumab and 294 patients received infliximab as first line biologic treatment for IBD. While 272 patients had EIM, 349 patients did not have EIM accompanying their IBD. EIM presence was not concluded in 52 patients from their medical charts. Smoking and family history were not different between patiemnts with and without EIM. However, female patients had statistically more EIM (51.3% vs. 38.1%, p<0.05) and patients with Crohn’s disease had statistically more EIM (49.4% vs 34.5%, p<0.05). Anti-TNF drug persistence was significantly higher in patients with EIM when compared to patients with no EIM (Figure 1). This difference was independent of the type of anti-TNF medication used. However, in patients with ulcerative colitis the difference became more significant, while in Crohn’s disease patients although there is trend, the difference was not significant. The concomitant use of immunomodulator drugs did not make any impact.



 In IBD patients, anti-TNF medication persistence was observed to be significantly longer in those with EIM. This difference was significantly greater in ulcerative colitis patients compared to Crohn’s patients. This difference was independent of the concomitant medication use.

 A significant number of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients report an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms under a gluten-free diet (GFD), despite not suffering from celiac disease. In a recent prospective pilot study, we detected a significant downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on the mucosal level, as well as slight compositional changes of the luminal microbiome after implementation of an eight-week GFD intervention in PSC-IBD patients (1). For a further characterization, we established murine models of IBD, investigating the influence of a GFD on colitis susceptibility, gut microbiota, and intestinal inflammation (Part A). Subsequently, a proof-of-concept human study was implemented as part of the miGut Health project for clinical correlation (Part B).



 A) C57BL/6 mice are either bred and kept under standard diet (SD, containing wheat) or GFD followed by induction of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis, a murine model for ulcerative colitis. Relative loss of bodyweight and mean endoscopic colitis score are measured. For characterization of the microbiota impact, murine stool transplantation into germ free mice and 16s RNA analyzes are performed.
 B) An investigator-initiated prospective clinical trial with one interventional arm in IBD patients will be performed at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf to investigate a 1.5-year long wheat protein-free diet in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and PSC-associated IBD (PSC-IBD), n=20 each. Effects of the GFD on intestinal cell composition and state, intestinal fecal and mucosal microbiota composition will be assessed as well as the dietary impact on IBD activity using colonoscopy and biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and on symptoms and health-related quality of life.



 A) Gluten aggravates murine DSS-colitis and long-term GFD (LT-GFD) protects mice from gluten aggravated colitis susceptibility. More importantly, preliminary data in germ-free settings support that this effect is mediated through microbiota alterations during the LT-GFD. 16s RNA sequencing data from murine stool showed different relative bacterial abundance.
 B) The study protocol received formal ethical approval by the ethics committee of the Hamburg Medical Association, Hamburg, Germany. Patient recruitment has started and is ongoing.



 These primary results underline a potential role of gut microbiota modulation for the positive effect of a GFD on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBD. Long-term tolerability and efficacy of the dietary intervention in IBD patients remain to be seen.

Urine metabolomics offers a non-invasive approach to diagnose and manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), by identifying distinct metabolic signatures.


OBJECTIVES
This narrative review summarizes current findings on urinary metabolites in IBD, evaluating their roles in disease differentiation, assessment of activity, and monitoring therapeutic response.


METHODS
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE up to October 2023 was conducted using keywords such as "urine metabolomics," "inflammatory bowel disease," "Crohn's disease," "ulcerative colitis," and "urinary biomarkers." Studies were included that described alterations to metabolic pathways, including those related to the urea cycle, central energy metabolism (Krebs cycle), amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters.


RESULTS
Specific urinary metabolites differentiate IBD patients from healthy controls and between CD and UC. Decreased urinary levels of hippurate, acetate, methanol, formate, and methylamine are observed in IBD, indicating altered gut microbiota. In CD patients, urea cycle alterations include reduced urinary urea and ornithine with increased arginine. Changes in Krebs cycle intermediates show decreased citrate and succinate in adults, but increased fumarate and isocitrate in pediatric patients, reflecting energy metabolism differences. Amino acid metabolism differs by age: adults exhibit decreased urinary asparagine, lysine, and histidine, while pediatric patients show increased methionine, proline, aspartic acid, and isoleucine. Elevated urinary neurotransmitters like dopamine are noted in pediatric IBD patients. Urine metabolomics also can monitor treatment efficacy by distinguishing responders from non-responders to therapies and differentiating active disease from remission.


CONCLUSION
Urine metabolomics provides promising, non-invasive biomarkers to enhance IBD diagnostics by distinguishing CD from UC and offering insights into underlying metabolic disturbances, paving the way for more precise, accessible patient care.">

 The treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) has advanced significantly with the introduction of targeted medications, such as IL-23-Inhibitors. However, treatment success in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) varies and requires reliable biomarkers to assess therapeutic efficacy. Tryptophan (Trp), an essential amino acid, plays a central role in gut metabolism and immune modulation. Recent studies have shown that Trp metabolism is associated with inflammatory processes and correlates with IBD activity.



 We hypothesized that Trp can serve as a reliable marker for assessing treatment success in patients with UC undergoing Mirikizumab therapy. To test this, Trp levels were correlated with established laboratory parameters (leukocytes, C-reactive protein in serum (CRP), fecal Calprotectin (fCal), as well as clinical parameters (IBD Disc).



 Laboratory and clinical parameters during induction and maintenance therapy of four patients with UC who were treated with Mirikizumab were analyzed. Using SPSS, the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlations between Trp and established markers.



 A significant negative correlation between Trp and CRP (n = 18, rs = −0.75, p < 0.001) suggests that lower Trp levels are associated with increased inflammatory activity. Correlations with leukocyte count (n = 18, rs = 0.27, p = 0.39), fCal (n = 10, rs = −0.33, p = 0.35), and the IBD Disk Score (n = 14, rs = −0.25, p = 0.40) were weak and not significant.



 The significant correlation between Trp and CRP suggests that Trp could serve as a potential monitoring tool for assessing the inflammatory status in UC patients undergoing Mirikizumab therapy. However, Trp appears to have limited value as a standalone marker, and no cut-off levels have been established. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the clinical relevance of Trp as a biomarker for treatment response to Mirikizumab.

 Resolvin E1 (RvE1), an endogenous lipid mediator, shows efficacy in murine colitis models by modulating mucosal immunity and protecting epithelial barrier function. RvE1 and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) are both BLT1 receptor agonists but elicit distinct biological outcomes through biased agonism. LTB4, a pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, initiates and regulates inflammatory responses by stimulating recruitment and activation of immune cells. In contrast, RvE1 selectively engages BLT1 to promote immune homeostasis and repair. TP-317, a stabilized RvE1 molecule, is being investigated as oral therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a sub-chronic murine model of DSS colitis, oral TP-317 (4.0 mg/kg) significantly improved disease activity and histological scores for mucosal inflammation and crypt loss. GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs support TP-317’s safety profile, with the highest RvE1 doses tested in both preclinical species determined to be the no observed adverse event levels (NOAEL). This Phase 1a clinical study describes the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety profile of TP-317 given as an enteric-coated tablet to healthy volunteers.



 Twenty-four subjects were randomized 3:1 to single oral doses of TP-317 at 10, 40 and 80 mg (n=8/group). Safety, tolerability and PK/PD were assessed using standard methods. Subjects receiving the 80 mg dose underwent frequent CBC testing to assess short-term fluctuations in circulating neutrophils.



 Oral TP-317 was well tolerated, producing peak plasma RvE1 concentrations exceeding the EC50 for BLT1 activation (~10 nM) by 1.2, 2.8, and 6.7 times at 10, 40, and 80 mg doses, respectively. The mean AUC of the 80 mg group met regulatory requirements when compared to NOAEL dose exposures in rats and dogs. All 80 mg subjects experienced transient neutropenia, with neutrophils dropping below 1500/mL near RvE1 peak, followed by complete recovery above normal within ~2 hours. A similar pattern was previously observed without safety concerns in healthy subjects receiving an RvE1 drug at 150 mg twice daily for 10 days.



 TP-317 demonstrates good tolerability and achieves adequate systemic RvE1 levels to engage the BLT1 receptor, offering a novel agonist approach to the LTB4-BLT1 pathway. Transient neutropenia observed with TP-317, a known effect of BLT1 activation by LTB4 and RvE1, suggests target engagement in humans. Oral TP-317’s safety profile and unique pro-resolution, barrier-protective mechanism warrant further clinical studies in IBD patients.

        <tr id="Immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporine, play a
vital role in the management of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Predominant
before the emergence of anti-TNF alpha biotherapies (2000s), they remain important,
particularly in combination with these new treatments to optimize clinical outcomes.
The aim of this work is to explore the role and importance of immunosuppressants in
the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis. This is a descriptive analysis highlighting how immunosuppressants
act at the immune level to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms in patients with
IBD. After discussing the risks and adverse effects associated with the use of
immunosuppressants, as well as strategies to minimize these effects, the need to
individualize treatment to each patient (clinical situation, response to treatment,
potential side effects) is highlighted. The benefits must be carefully weighed regarding
the potential risks, requiring careful monitoring throughout the treatment.">

        <tr id="To help understand the complex and therapeutically challenging inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), we developed a systems biology model of the intestinal immune system that is able to describe main aspects of IBD and different treatment modalities thereof. The model, including key cell types and processes of the mucosal immune response, compiles a large amount of isolated experimental findings from literature into a larger context and allows for simulations of different inflammation scenarios based on the underlying data and assumptions. In the context of a large and diverse virtual IBD population, we characterized the patients based on their phenotype (in contrast to healthy individuals, they developed persistent inflammation after a trigger event) rather than on a priori assumptions on parameter differences to a healthy individual. This allowed to reproduce the enormous diversity of predispositions known to lead to IBD. Analyzing different treatment effects, the model provides insight into characteristics of individual drug therapy. We illustrate for anti‐TNF‐α therapy, how the model can be used (i) to decide for alternative treatments with best prospects in the case of nonresponse, and (ii) to identify promising combination therapies with other available treatment options.">

        <tr id="Crohn’s Disease (CD) results from inappropriate response toward commensal flora. Earlier studies described CD as a Th1 mediated disease. Current models view both phenotypes as a continuum of various permutations between Th1, Th2 and Th17 pathways compounded by a range of Treg disfunctions. In the present paper, we develop a mathematical model, by a system of differential equations, which describe the dynamic relations among these T cells and their cytokines. The model identities four groups of CD patients according to up/down regulation of Th1 and Th2. The model simulations show that immunosuppression by TNF-α blockage benefits the group with Th1High/Th2Low while, by contrast, the group with Th1Low/Th2High will benefit from immune activation.">

        <tr id="Several PI3K inhibitors are in clinical development for the treatment of various forms of cancers, including pan‐PI3K inhibitors targeting all four PI3K isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ), and isoform‐selective inhibitors. Diarrhea and immune‐mediated colitis are among the adverse events observed with PI3K inhibition which limits the maximal tolerated dose. A quantitative systems pharmacology model was developed to investigate PI3K‐inhibitor‐induced colitis. The effects of individual PI3K isoforms on relevant cellular pathways were incorporated into a mechanistic representation of mucosal inflammation. A virtual clinical population captures the observed clinical variability in the onset timing and rates of diarrhea and colitis for seven clinically tested PI3K inhibitors. Model‐based analysis suggests that colitis development is governed by both the inhibition of PI3Kδ, which drives T cell differentiation and proliferation, and PI3Kα, which regulates epithelial barrier integrity. Specifically, when PI3Kα is inhibited below a given threshold, epithelial barrier dysfunction precipitates an exaggerated T effector response due to PI3Kδ‐inhibition, leading to risk of diarrhea and colitis. This synergy explains why the lowest diarrhea and colitis rates are seen with the weakest PI3Kδ inhibition (alpelisib), and higher rates are seen with strong PI3Kδ inhibition if PI3Kα is even mildly inhibited (e.g., idelalisib), whereas strong PI3Kδ inhibition in the absence of PI3Kα inhibition does not result in high colitis rates (umbralisib). Thus, the model‐based analysis suggests that PI3Kα and δ inhibition play unique but synergistic roles in driving colitis. Finally, we explore if and how dose‐regimen might influence colitis rates for molecules that inhibit both PI3Kα and PI3Kδ.">

The model structure is consistent between healthy volunteers and IBD disease phenotype, with 24 parameters changed between diseases. Modular nature of the model allows for easy incorporation of new mechanisms or modification of existing interactions. Model simulations for steady‐state levels of proteins and cells in the blood and gut using a population approach are consistent with published data. By simulating the response of two clinical biomarkers, C‐reactive protein and fecal calprotectin, to parameter perturbations, the model explores hypotheses for possible treatment mechanisms. With additional experimental validation and addition of drug treatments, the model provides a platform to test hypothesis on treatment effects in IBD.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disease with multiple underlying influences and notable heterogeneity among its clinical and response‐to‐treatment phenotypes. There is no cure for IBD, and none of the currently available therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacies beyond 40%–60%. Data collected about its omics, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies have grown exponentially with time making IBD a prime candidate for artificial intelligence (AI) mediated discovery support. AI can be leveraged to further understand or identify IBD features to improve clinical outcomes. Various treatment candidates are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, offering further approaches and opportunities for increasing the efficacies of treatments. However, currently, therapeutic plans are largely determined using clinical features due to the lack of specific biomarkers, and it has become necessary to step into precision medicine to predict therapeutic responses to guarantee optimal treatment efficacy. This is accompanied by the application of AI and the development of multiscale hybrid models combining mechanistic approaches and machine learning. These models ultimately lead to the creation of digital twins of given patients delivering on the promise of precision dosing and tailored treatment. Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a prominent cytokine in cell‐to‐cell communication in the inflammatory responses’ regulation. Dysregulated IL‐6‐induced signaling leads to severe immunological or proliferative pathologies, such as IBD and colon cancer. This mini‐review explores multiscale models with the aim of predicting the response to therapy in IBD. Modeling IL‐6 biology and generating digital twins enhance the credibility of their prediction.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a protracted, persistent gastrointestinal disease that is distinguished by recurring, persistent inflammation of the digestive tract. IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by persistent inflammation due to immune dysregulation. Interleukin -17 (IL-17) contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of IBD, as highlighted in the context of the provided research. There is a strong correlation between IL-17 inhibitors and the onset or exacerbation of IBD, with IL-17 inhibitor treatment being linked to gastrointestinal inflammatory events such as IBD and colitis. The goal of the current study was to determine the relationship between IBD disease activity and serum IL-17 levels in individuals with IBD. This case-control study included 102 IBD patients and 48 normal individuals as a control group. Blood samples were used for measuring IL-17 levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of IL-17 were increased in patients compared with the control group (p=0.0001). IL-17 levels were significantly elevated in patients aged 1-15 years, 31-45 years and 16-30 years. IL-17 levels showed significant differences between two types of inflammatory bowel disease being elevated in Crohn's disease more than ulcerative colitis (p=0.001). IL-17 demonstrated significant differences in IL-17 levels between male and female in patients and controls groups (p=0.0001). In conclusion, patients with IBD have higher serum levels of IL-17, indicating that these cytokines may have a role in the development and pathophysiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Overall, monitoring IL-17 levels could serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing IBD severity and guiding treatment decisions.">

        <tr id="Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease with complex causes that are closely associated with environmental, genetic, and immune factors. However, the precise etiology and pathogenesis remain under investigation in clinical practice. Extensive research has demonstrated that cytokines play a pivotal role in the development, occurrence, and prognosis of UC, with an imbalance between pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory factors being a significant contributor. Given that UC is challenging to cure, therapeutic options such as hormones and aminosalicylic acid are commonly employed. While treatments including Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and other approaches have shown some efficacy, substantial breakthroughs are still lacking. Cytokines, therefore, represent a critical focus in understanding the pathogenesis of UC. This review explores the therapeutic pathways of cytokines and their antagonists.">

        <tr id="Treatments for Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), two conditions that fall under the umbrella of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), must be both safe and effective. This review compares the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF agents and IL-12/23 inhibitors, specifically in the context of IBD management. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and meta-analyses involving adult IBD patients were all included in the review. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab and adalimumab) were shown to significantly improve clinical remission rates and reduce complications, particularly with early intervention. However, these agents were associated with adverse effects such as infections and autoimmune reactions. IL-12/23 inhibitors, particularly risankizumab, showed superior efficacy in achieving and maintaining remission with a better safety profile. The findings prove that IL-12/23 inhibitors might be more effective for patients who are unresponsive to anti-TNF therapies. In conclusion, both anti-TNF agents and IL-12/23 inhibitors effectively manage IBD, with IL-12/23 inhibitors offering a favorable safety profile. Early intervention and personalized treatment strategies are significant for optimizing patient outcomes. It will take additional research to validate these results and improve treatment strategies.Keywords: Anti-TNF Drugs, Crohn's Disease, IL-12/23 Inhibitors, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Ulcerative Colitis">

Fibroblasts contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulating immune cell activity, and promoting fibrosis. In addition, fibroblasts play crucial roles in tissue repair and regeneration following acute injury or chronic inflammation. The dysregulation of fibroblast functions can lead to fibrotic complications, such as intestinal strictures and obstruction, which are common in advanced stages of IBD. Understanding the complex interplay between fibroblasts and other cell types in the intestine is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of intestinal diseases and identify novel therapeutic targets. Future research aimed at deciphering the heterogeneity of intestinal fibroblasts and their dynamic roles in disease progression holds promise for the development of precision therapies to mitigate fibrosis and inflammation in intestinal disorders.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with a complex aetiopathogenesis, whose development is influenced by many factors. The prevalence of IBD is increasing worldwide, in both industrialized and developing countries, making IBD a global health problem that seriously affects quality of life. In 2019, there were approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD worldwide. Such a large number of patients entails significant healthcare costs. In the treatment of patients with IBD, the current therapeutic target is mucosal healing, as intestinal inflammation often persists despite resolution of abdominal symptoms. Treatment strategies include amino salicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies that focus on reducing intestinal mucosal inflammation, inducing and prolonging disease remission, and treating complications. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines also indicate that nutritional therapies may be considered in addition to other therapies. However, current therapeutic approaches are not fully effective and are associated with various limitations, such as drug resistance, variable efficacy, and side effects. As the chronic inflammation that accompanies IBD is characterized by infiltration of a variety of immune cells and increased expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ, new therapeutic approaches are mainly targeting immune pathways. Interleukins are one of the molecular targets in IBD therapy. Interleukins and related cytokines serve as a means of communication for innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as nonimmune cells and tissues. These cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis and course of IBD, making them promising targets for current and future therapies. In our work, we review scientific studies published between January 2022 and November 2024 describing the most important interleukins involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Some of the papers present new data on the precise role that individual interleukins play in IBD. New clinical data have also been provided, particularly on blocking interleukin 23 and interleukin 1beta. In addition, several new approaches to the use of different interleukins in the treatment of IBD have been described in recent years.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, with Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) being the most common. While still not fully understood, pathogenesis is believed to be multifactorial – the result of an interplay between genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation and environmental factors that all lead to chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling. Innate immune cells, which orchestrate the initial defense mechanisms and modulate the subsequent immune response, play a central role in disease initiation and progression. This review examines the complex involvement of innate immune cells in IBD, emphasizing their interactions with environmental factors and the gut microbiome. We highlight the importance of microbial dysbiosis and impaired intestinal barrier function in disease pathogenesis, and the role that innate immune cells play not only as first responders, but also as key players in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiome. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the role that innate immune cells play in IBD pathogenesis with emphasis on the increasingly recognized role of the gut microbiome. A better understanding of innate immune cell mechanisms and of microbiome-immune interactions is key for the development of novel targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a prevalent inflammatory bowel disease primarily impacting the mucosa of the colon. It is characterized by recurring and incurable symptoms and causes immense suffering and significant economic burden due to limited treatment options. Typical symptoms of UC include diarrhea, alterations in bowel patterns, bleeding from the rectum, rectal pain or urgency, anemia, and tiredness. Therefore, developing novel and effective treatment strategies for UC is imperative. Purpose This review aimed to explain how macrophage polarization contributes to UC development and compiled information on natural compounds with promising therapeutic potential that can target the macrophage phenotype and shed light on its potential mode of action. Results The phenotypic alteration of macrophages profoundly affects the development of UC, and these cells are essential for preserving intestinal immunological homeostasis. Evidence from research suggests that one effective method for UC prevention and therapy is to guide macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype. Phytochemicals, which are compounds extracted from plants, possess a wide array of biological activities. For example: Ginsenoside Rg1 emerges as a crucial regulator of macrophage polarization, promoting the M2 phenotype while inhibiting the M1 phenotype. Notably, their low toxicity and high effectiveness render them promising candidates for therapeutic interventions. These compounds have demonstrated encouraging protective effects against inflammation in the colon. Conclusions Exploring phytochemicals as a therapeutic avenue targeting macrophage polarization presents an innovative approach to treating UC.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic, relapsing conditions characterized by dysregulated immune responses and persistent intestinal inflammation. This review aims to examine new potential therapeutic targets in IBD starting from the STRIDE-II statements. Key targets now include clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and biomarker normalization (such as C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin). Moreover, histologic remission, transmural remission, and in the future molecular targets are emerging as important indicators of sustained disease control. The treatment goals for inflammatory bowel disease are varied: to relieve symptoms, prevent permanent intestinal damage, promote inflammation remission, and minimize complications. Consequently, the therapeutic targets have evolved to become broader and more ambitious. Integrating these advanced therapeutic targets has the potential to redefine IBD management by promoting deeper disease control and improved patient outcomes. Further research is essential to validate these strategies and optimize their clinical implementation.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), present ongoing challenges despite advances in pathophysiological understanding and therapeutic options. Current therapies often fail to achieve sustained remission, necessitating exploration of novel treatment targets.


AREAS COVERED
This review explores the role of Tumor Necrosis Factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) and its receptor DR3 in IBD pathogenesis, detailing their involvement in mucosal homeostasis and immune modulation. Recent studies on TL1A inhibitors highlight their potential in mitigating inflammation and fibrosis in IBD.


EXPERT OPINION
TL1A inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, supported by encouraging outcomes in clinical trials for moderate to severe IBD. Future research may elucidate TL1A's broader impact on immunity, epithelial integrity and fibrosis, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and biomarker discovery. Ongoing phase 3 trials are pivotal in assessing TL1A inhibitors as effective and safe treatments for IBD. Additionally, exploration of TL1A's role in fibrosis-associated complications and its potential as a biomarker for treatment response holds promise for personalized medicine approaches. Consideration of TL1A inhibition in concurrent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases suggests broader therapeutic implications beyond gastrointestinal manifestations of IBD.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Current immune-modulating therapies are insufficient for 30–50% of patients or cause significant side effects, emphasizing the need for new treatments. Targeting the innate immune system and enhancing drug delivery to inflamed gut regions are promising strategies. Neutrophils play a central role in IBD by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) —DNA-based structures with cytotoxic proteins—that contribute to mucosal damage and inflammation. Recent studies linking ROS production, DNA repair, and NET formation have identified NETs as potential therapeutic targets, with preclinical models showing positive outcomes from NET inhibition. Innovative oral drug delivery systems designed to target gut inflammation directly—without systemic absorption—could improve treatment precision and reduce side effects. Advanced formulations utilize properties such as particle size, surface modifications, and ROS-triggered release to selectively target the distal ileum and colon. A dual strategy that combines a deeper understanding of IBD pathophysiology to identify inflammation-related therapeutic targets with advanced drug delivery systems may offer significant promise. For instance, pairing NET inhibition with ROS-responsive nanocarriers could enhance treatment efficacy, though further research is needed. This synergistic approach has the potential to greatly improve outcomes for IBD patients.">

        <tr id="The persistent inflammation of the intestinal mucosa is the main characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a lifelong illness that affects people of both genders. The exact etiology is still undefined while previously it was attributed to genetic components. Later, it was investigated that the environment has an equal effect on the development of IBD encompassing both Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Among environmental risk factors linked to IBD, diet, notably the transition toward the Western diet, is the most noticeable element that contributes to IBD. This comprehensive overview summarizes the present literature on the role of food and food groups in IBD nutrition and management. Increased consumption of sugar, fats, and/or proteins, decreased consumption of fruits and vegetables, and increased use of emulsifiers or other binding compounds are among the most significant candidates that lead to inflammation in the intestines of healthy individuals. Furthermore, low dietary habits, including selective malnutrition, obesity, and sarcopenia, are linked with poor clinical results, treatment responsiveness, and, as a result, quality of life. Therefore, the trend in the management of IBD has shifted toward dietary therapies and strategies like Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), the Mediterranean diet (MD), Enteral Nutrition (EN), Crohn’s disease exclusion diet (CDED), Inflammatory bowel disease-Anti-inflammatory diet (IBD-AID), and others are reported to have had a positive association with reducing the underlying IBD symptoms and remission of intestinal homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, represents a complex and growing global health issue with a multifaceted origin. This review delves into the intricate relationship between gut microbiota, autophagy, and the development of IBD. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms, plays a vital role in maintaining gut health, while imbalances in this microbial community, known as dysbiosis, are linked to IBD. Autophagy, a process by which cells recycle their components, is essential for gut homeostasis and the regulation of immune responses. When autophagy is impaired and dysbiosis occurs, they individually contribute to IBD, with their combined impact intensifying inflammation. The interconnectedness of gut microbiota, autophagy, and the host’s immune system is central to the onset of IBD. The review also examines how diet influences gut microbiota and its subsequent effects on IBD. It highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the microbiota and modulating autophagic pathways as treatment strategies for IBD. Understanding these interactions could lead to personalized therapies within the rapidly advancing fields of microbiome research and immunology.">

IBD, encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is intricately shaped by a nexus of genetic and environmental factors, and its global prevalence is increasing. Genetic research has identified pivotal variants — NOD2, ATG16L1, and IL23R — linked to IBD, influencing key pathways, such as autophagy, interleukin signaling, and bacterial management. These genetic variants, integral to IBD's etiology of IBD, have functional significance because they perturb immune regulation, compromise epithelial barrier integrity, and disrupt mucosal homeostasis, collectively contributing to intestinal inflammation through diverse mechanisms. Early detection of IBD is paramount for arresting disease progression and underscoring the importance of prognostic testing and genetic screening, especially in cases with familial predispositions or very early onset IBD. Additionally, the use of certain IBD medications, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and infliximab, may have implications for male fertility, necessitating a nuanced understanding of these potential effects for informed decision-making in IBD management. This comprehensive understanding of the genetic landscape, functional implications, and diagnostic strategies is vital for advancing personalized treatments and improving outcomes in individuals with IBD.Conclusion. IBD is a complex gastrointestinal disorder influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variants, including NOD2, ATG16L1, and IL23R, contribute to dysregulation of immune responses, epithelial barrier function, and mucosal homeostasis. While progress has been made in understanding the genetic landscape of IBD, ongoing research is needed to elucidate the functional consequences of these variants, identify causal genes, and explore gene-environment interactions. This deeper understanding holds the potential for more precise diagnostics and personalized treatments, ultimately improving outcomes in individuals living with IBD.">

        <tr id="Abstract: The introduction of biological therapies has revolutionized inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. A critical consideration in developing these therapies is ensuring adequate drug concentrations at the site of action. While blood-based biomarkers have shown limited utility in optimizing treatment (except for TNF-alpha inhibitors and thiopurines), tissue drug concentrations may offer valuable insights. In antimicrobial therapies, tissue concentration monitoring is standard practice and could provide a new avenue for understanding the pharmacokinetics of biological and small-molecule therapies in IBD. Various methods exist for measuring tissue concentrations, including whole tissue sampling, MALDI-MSI, microdialysis, and fluorescent labeling. These techniques offer unique advantages, such as spatial drug-distribution mapping, continuous sampling, or cellular-level analysis. However, challenges remain, including sampling invasiveness, heterogeneity in tissue compartments, and a lack of standardized bioanalytical guidelines. Drug pharmacokinetics are influenced by multiple factors, including molecular properties, disease-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and the timing of sample collection. For example, drug permeability, solubility, and interaction with transporters may vary between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Research into the tissue concentrations of drugs like anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib has shown variable correlations with clinical outcomes, suggesting potential roles for tissue concentration monitoring in therapeutic drug management. Although routine clinical application is not yet established, exploring tissue drug concentrations may enhance understanding of IBD pharmacotherapy.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract with a progressive and relapsing course. Achieving mucosal healing has emerged as a critical therapeutic goal, as it is associated with sustained clinical remission, reduced hospitalizations, and fewer surgery rates. Therefore, targeting mucosal healing is essential for long-term control in CD.


AREAS COVERED
This review evaluates the efficacy of novel biologic therapies and small molecules in inducing mucosal healing, specifically targeting pathways like IL-12/23, IL-23, α4β7 integrins, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) in adults (≥18 years) with moderate-to-severe CD. The rationale for selecting these specific pathways is their central role in modulating key inflammatory processes implicated in CD pathogenesis. We compare these therapies with placebo for both induction and maintenance of remission, based on a PubMed literature review for published articles and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.


EXPERT OPINION
Upadacitinib and anti-IL23p19 agents (risankizumab, guselkumab and mirikizumab) are promising advanced non-TNF-targeting therapies for inducing endoscopic remission and mucosal healing but further studies are needed to integrate mucosal healing into a broader definition of endoscopic response, with a unified and precise definition.">

        <tr id="Irritable bowel disease (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a persistent and recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Despite the increasing prevalence of IBD globally, its precise aetiology remains unidentified, and no definitive treatment or cure has been established. The intricate interplay among environmental influences, genetics, and the host's immune system is believed to be the primary aetiology of IBD. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies indicate that IBD is linked to alterations in the function and composition of the gut microbiota, called dysbiosis. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that dysbiosis plays a crucial part in the onset of IBD. Despite extensive investigations aimed at identifying new pathogenic factors related to IBD, encompassing environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune response elements, a comprehensive knowledge of IBD aetiology still needs to be identified as the treatment for IBD patients requires improved outcomes. A more profound comprehension of the disease's aetiology may yield distinctive insights applicable to developing therapeutic strategies for IBD. Recent research has markedly enhanced our understanding of the pathobiology of IBD, resulting in substantial progress in its diagnosis and treatment. We have emphasized current advancements and discoveries about emerging elements that contribute to disease pathogenesis, such as gut microbiota, which significantly influence the aetiology of IBD and may serve as prospective targets for innovative therapeutics in IBD patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Existing findings on outcomes of anti-tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are largely based on retrospective studies. We aimed to investigate real-world outcomes of anti-TNF therapy and predictors thereof in a prospective IBD cohort.


METHODS
In a Danish multicenter cohort of adult bio-naïve patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF, we assessed clinical response and remission to induction therapy using clinical disease activity scoring indices at week 14. In patients who continued treatment beyond the induction period, we also assessed loss of response (LOR), drug withdrawal, and major IBD surgery during maintenance therapy.


RESULTS
This study included 774 patients (706 infliximab, 68 adalimumab) followed for a median duration of 125 weeks Clinical response was achieved in 209/331 (67.4%) of ulcerative colitis (UC) and 125/197 (74.0%) of Crohn's disease (CD) patients, while 143/331 (46.1%) UC and 81/197 (47.9%) CD patients achieved clinical remission. In 294 UC and 309 CD patients who received maintenance therapy, 86/294 (29.3%) UC and 78/309 (25.2%) CD patients experienced LOR. Active smoking and less severe disease activity predicted favorable outcomes in UC, while short disease duration, colonic disease, non-stricturing behavior, and concomitant immunomodulator therapy predicted favorable outcomes in CD.


CONCLUSIONS
Clinical response was achieved in two in three UC and three in four CD patients, meanwhile, one-third of UC and one-fourth of CD patients experienced LOR despite the short disease duration in this study. Several clinical features were associated with outcomes and may be useful predictors of anti-TNF treatment response.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of chronic conditions, primarily comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, characterized by inflammation of the intestines. Despite the absence of a specific cause, inheritance, climate, and bacteria disparities are acknowledged to be potential assumptions. Flavonoids, particularly kaempferol, have come to be useful natural remedies for IBD. Kaempferol, a variety of fruits and vegetables, is renowned for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and enzyme-modulating components. Kaempferol has been proven to have anti-inflammatory effects through the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, including lowering Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) levels, regulating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, and inhibiting pro-inflammation mediators. In vitro and in vivo models of IBD and UC proved the therapeutic effects of kaempferol through alleviating inflammatory effects, protecting the barrier from dysfunction, and regulating gut microbiota. Further clinical trials are required to understand kaempferol's ability to treat IBD and its potential as a possible pharmaceutical agent">

        <tr id="Background and Aims: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires effective treatment options. Upadacitinib, a Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, has shown effectiveness in trials for Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This study evaluates its real-world effectiveness and safety. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in tertiary care centers, involving patients treated with upadacitinib from January 2023 to September 2024. The study included adult patients aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with UC or CD, who received at least 8 weeks of upadacitinib therapy. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using established clinical, endoscopic, imaging, histological, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 236 IBD patients received upadacitinib treatment. In 80 UC patients at 8 weeks, 64.0% achieved steroid-free remission, 57.6% clinical remission, and 81.8% response. Endoscopic remission was 35.8% (p = 0.039), with 63.3% response and 35.8% mucosal healing. Histological remission reached 29.2% (p = 0.009). For 156 CD patients at 12 weeks, 76.8% achieved steroid-free remission (p < 0.001), 77.8% clinical remission (p < 0.001), and 81.0% response. Mean CDAI decreased from 214.9 to 117.5 (p < 0.001). Endoscopic remission was 19.4%, with 48.9% response and 4.9% mucosal healing. Radiological remission was 9.1% with 85.7% response. Intestinal ultrasound showed 5.7% remission and 56.7% response. Conclusions: Upadacitinib demonstrates significant real-world effectiveness and safety in IBD, particularly in biologic-resistant cases, as evidenced by high rates of steroid-free remission and clinical response. These outcomes are likely due to its targeted JAK1 inhibition, which effectively reduces inflammation and promotes mucosal healing. Future research should focus on long-term safety, comparative effectiveness with other biologics, and its application in diverse patient populations. These findings support the integration of upadacitinib into IBD management strategies.">

MV130 is a mucosal-trained immunity-based vaccine used to prevent respiratory tract infections in various clinical settings. Additionally, MV130 may induce innate immune cells that acquire anti-inflammatory properties and promote tolerance, which could have important implications for chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis. This work demonstrated that the prophylactic administration of MV130 substantially mitigated colitis in a mouse model of acute colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium. MV130 downregulated systemic and local inflammatory responses, maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier by preserving the enterocyte layer and goblet cells, and reduced the oedema and fibrosis characteristic of the disease. Mechanistically, MV130 significantly reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages in the intestinal wall of the diseased animals and favoured the appearance of M2-polarised macrophages. These results suggest that MV130 might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, reducing the risk of relapse and the progression of disease.">

Through the coupled analysis of transcriptome and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene in individual cells, we characterized the cellular composition, transcriptome and Ig clonotype in different B cell subtypes. We observed shared disruptions in plasma cell (PC) responses between different IBD subtypes. We revealed heterogeneity in memory B cells (MBCs) and showed a positive correlation between gut resident-like MBCs and disease severity. Furthermore, our clonotype analysis demonstrated an increased direct differentiation of MBCs into PCs in CD patients. Overall, this study demonstrates significantly altered B cell responses associated with chronic inflammation during CD and highlights the potential role of mucosal MBCs in CD pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Inflammatory proteins have the potential to be used as therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Methods: We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to probe causal associations between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and IBD in the discovery and replication cohorts. Subsequently, we conducted meta-analysis of results from two cohorts. We further conducted protein-protein interaction (PPI), enrichment analysis, and druggability evaluation to elucidate our results and prioritize potential therapeutic targets.
Results: By integrating data from two cohorts, we demonstrated that genetically predicted CD40 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.878, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.838-0.919) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)5 (OR = 0.884, 95%CI = 0.841-0.930) decreased IBD risk. However, genetically predicted CXCL9 (OR = 1.184, 95%CI = 1.084-1.294), Interleukin (IL)-18 (OR = 1.140, 95%CI = 1.076-1.208), CD6 (OR = 1.096, 95%CI = 1.045-1.150), and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (OR = 1.154, 95%CI = 1.070-1.244) increased IBD risk. Moreover, genetically predicted CD40 (OR = 0.855, 95%CI = 0.801-0.912) decreased Crohn’s disease (CD) risk. Genetically predicted fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) (OR = 1.259, 95%CI = 1.135-1.397) and 4E-BP1 (OR = 1.202, 95%CI = 1.088-1.327) increased CD risk. We found no inflammatory protein associated with ulcerative colitis. Additionally, CD was significantly associated with elevated levels of three circulating inflammatory proteins, which are suggested to be the consequences of CD. PPI analysis demonstrated interactions between CXCL5, CXCL9, IL-18, CD40, and FGF21. Enrichment analysis indicated these identified proteins significantly enriched in inflammation-related signaling pathways, including interleukin signaling, cytokine signaling, and NF-κB pathway. Three proteins (CD40, IL-18, 4E-BP1) have been targeted for drug development on cancers and immune-related diseases, with potentials of therapeutic targets for IBD.
Conclusions: Our results provide new biomarkers and drug targets for CD. Moreover, we further demonstrate critical roles of inflammation and immunity in the occurrence and development of IBD.

        <tr id="Although biologics have been revolutionizing the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over the past decade, a significant number of patients still fail to benefit from these drugs. Overcoming the nonresponse to biologics is one of the top challenges in IBD treatment. In this study, we revealed that hyaluronan (HA), an extracellular matrix (ECM) component in the gut, is associated with nonresponsiveness to infliximab and vedolizumab therapy in patients with IBD. In murine colitis models, inhibition of HA synthase 2–mediated (HAS2-mediated) HA synthesis sensitized the therapeutic response to infliximab. Mechanistically, HA induced the expression of MMP3 in colonic fibroblasts by activating STAT3 signaling, thereby mediating the proteolytic cleavage of multiple IgG1 biologics. Finally, we found that macrophage-derived factors upregulated HAS2 expression in fibroblasts, thereby contributing to infliximab nonresponse. In summary, we identified a pathogenic connection between abnormal ECM remodeling and biologics nonresponse and provided insights for the precise therapy for IBD.">

        <tr id="Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory condition affecting the colon, primarily impacting individuals aged 30 to 40. It typically begins in the rectum and gradually progresses to the proximal regions of the colon, characterized by recurrent and remitting mucosal inflammation. Ulcerative colitis is categorized under inflammatory bowel disease, which encompasses various gastrointestinal tract disorders, but its underly-ing pathophysiology remains unclear. The development of ulcerative colitis is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and inflammatory factors. The severity of the disease guides the management of ulcerative colitis. Restorative strategies include the use of TNF-α (anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha) monoclonal antibodies. Janus Kinase inhibi-tors suppress cell signaling of the innate immune system. As ongoing research continues, the treatment options for ulcerative colitis are continually evolving and improving. Vari-ous types of dosage forms (tablets, capsules, suppositories, etc.) are available in the market for managing ulcerative colitis, with the primary goal of achieving and maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission of the disease. Ensuring a high level of patient compliance is crucial when considering the formulation of these dosage forms. This review article seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of ulcerative colitis while highlighting the existing treatment options on various available dosage forms.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
With limited evidence connecting paradoxical inflammatory bowel disease (paradoxical IBD) to the newest biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors, our study aims to investigate the occurrence of paradoxical IBD induced by these agents in treating other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). We aim to identify associated risk signals, the primary affected population, and the risk profile changes over time.


METHODS
We performed disproportionality analysis to evaluate paradoxical IBD risk signals using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Stratification analyses according to IBD subtype, age, gender, and agents' indications were performed. Weibull shape parameter (WSP) test was conducted to assess paradoxical IBD risk changes over time. Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian Randomization were employed to evaluate genetic correlations and causality between these agents' indications (i.e., non-IBD IMIDs) and IBD.


RESULTS
This study included 3296 patients reporting 3407 occurrences of paradoxical IBD following using these agents as primary suspects. Among TNF blockers, consistent positive signals for paradoxical IBD were noted: Adalimumab (n = 1983, ROR [95%CI] = 1.55 [1.47-1.63]), Infliximab (n = 545, ROR [95%CI] = 2.12 [1.95-2.32]), Certolizumab Pegol (n = 342, ROR [95%CI] = 1.9 [1.71-2.12]), and Golimumab (n = 154, ROR [95%CI] = 1.64 [1.4-1.93]). Ustekinumab, an IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist, also showed a strong positive signal (n = 155, ROR [95%CI] = 2.03 [1.73-2.39]). Conversely, Upadacitinib, Tofacitinib (Janus kinase inhibitors), and Risankizumab (IL-23 antagonist) exhibited insignificant associations with paradoxical IBD. Crohn's disease (CD) is the mainly developing form. WSP analysis identified two temporal patterns of paradoxical IBD: early failure and random failure types. Significant genetic correlations between three IMIDs and IBD were uncovered, with psoriasis specifically found to causally elevate CD risk.


CONCLUSIONS
This study identifies paradoxical IBD as a consistent positive signal across multiple IMID agents, predominantly manifesting as CD, potentially aiding in timely detection and therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Background: Many IBD patients do not react to traditional or biological therapies. Research suggests that Mirikizumab and Etrasimod may be effective therapy options for these individuals. This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of utilizing Mirikizumab and Etrasimod to treat moderate to severe IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, and WHO Trials Registry (ICTRP). We included RCTs that compared Mirikizumab and Etrasimod to placebo in patients with active CD or UC. The principal results were mucosal healing as well as the clinical response and remission throughout the induction and maintenance periods. The frequency of severe adverse events was the secondary outcome. Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 4 (Biostat Inc., USA) was utilized in the study.
Results: A total of Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Of these, fourteen studies examined the effectiveness and safety of Mirikizumab and Etrasimod in patients with UC, while three research looked at same topics in patients with CD. In people with moderately to highly active CD or UC, the meta-analysis showed that both Mirikizumab and Etrasimod therapies were more effective than placebo in inducing clinical response and achieving clinical remission during the induction and maintenance stages of treatment. Interestingly, we discovered that for patients with UC but not CD, Mirikizumab was a better first-line therapy than Etrasimod.
Conclusion: Mirikizumab and Etrasimod are safe and effective treatments for patients with CD and UC. RCTs including a greater number of patients are still necessary, nevertheless, in order to more accurately evaluate the safety profile of Mirikizumab and Etrasimod.">

In this review, we summarize the main features of the predominant types of inflammasomes involved in gastrointestinal immune responses and their implications in intestinal disease, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), celiac disease, and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). In addition, we report therapeutic discoveries that target the inflammasome pathway, highlighting promising novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of intestinal diseases. Collectively, our understanding of the mechanisms of intestinal inflammasome activation and their interactions with other immune pathways appear to be not fully elucidated. Moreover, the clinical relevance of the efficacy of inflammasome inhibitors has not been evaluated. Despite these limitations, a greater understanding of the effectiveness, specificity, and reliability of pharmacological and natural inhibitors that target inflammasome components could be an opportunity to develop new therapeutic options for the treatment of intestinal disease.">

The traditional combination of biologics and immunomodulators has demonstrated preliminary efficacy by enhancing the effects of biologics through immunomodulation. However, concerns regarding long-term safety warrant careful evaluation. Recent trials, including DUET-Crohn's disease and DUET-ulcerative colitis, have shown promising potential for the broader adoption of DBT.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
It remains unclear why up to 30% of ulcerative colitis patients (UC) do not respond to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). Validated biomarkers for (non-)response ((N)R) are lacking. Most studies investigating underlying mechanisms do not differentiate between pharmacokinetic and inflammatory mechanisms. We therefore aimed to develop a framework to correct for mucosal drug exposure (MDE) and applied this on mucosal cytokine profiles previously linked to (N)R.


METHODS
In a prospective international cohort, we studied patients with active moderate-severe UC starting TNFi treatment. Patients underwent endoscopy before (Baseline) and after induction treatment (Follow-up). NR was defined as absence of Mayo endoscopic subscore improvement by central read or need for colectomy. The ratio of mucosal concentrations of TNFi/TNF was used to define high or low MDE. Mucosal concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), Oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-12/23p40 (IL-12/IL-23p40) were measured.


RESULTS
Fifty-four UC patients were included (43 infliximab, 11 adalimumab) of whom 39 (72%) were endoscopic responders (after a median treatment of 62 days [48-96]). NR with high MDE had high IL-6 at both timepoints. R with low MDE exhibited low mucosal IL-10 at baseline. At follow-up, high OSM was associated with NR (irrespective of MDE) and high IL-12/IL-23p40 with R.


CONCLUSION
We incorporated MDE in mucosal cytokine research to avoid bias due to insufficient presence of anti-TNF. When applied to mucosal cytokines previously linked to (N)R, IL-6 appears to drive inflammation in TNFi resistant UC patients, while OSM seems to parallel inflammation and does not cause refractoriness.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s disease (CD), are primarily treated with therapies aimed at alleviating inflammation. Notably, biological agents like TNFα inhibitors have transformed the management of these conditions. Previous research has indicated that TNFα inhibitors affect the cells in the lamina propria. However, this study demonstrates that infliximab, a type of TNFα inhibitor, reduces the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and alleviates inflammation of CD by targeting follicular dendritic cells and macrophages within these structures. TLS could also be a potential target for various biological agents used to treat inflammatory diseases beyond CD. Furthermore, our study suggests that the status of TLS may serve as a predictor for the response to TNFα inhibitor treatment. Our research could pave the way for new treatment strategies and the advancement of personalized medicine for inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often reported on from a system or cost viewpoint. We created and explored a novel patient-perceived burden of disease (PPBoD) score in a large Australasian cohort.


AIM
To create and explore a novel patient-perceived burden of disease (PPBoD) score in a large Australasian cohort, and correlate PPBoD scores with demographics, disease and treatment factors.


METHODS
The Crohn Colitis Care Registry was interrogated in October 2023. Data from adults with IBD with an outpatient care encounter in the last 14 months among 17 centres were included. A novel PPBoD score was designed for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn disease (CD) and IBD-unclassified (IBDU). Correlations between PPBoD scores and demographics, disease and treatment factors were examined.


RESULTS
Of those with adequate data, 46.7% (2653/5685) had no PPBoD, 34.6% (1969/5685) had mild, 11.3% (641/5685) had moderate and 7.4% (422/5685) had significant PPBoD. New Zealanders were more likely to have higher PPBoD compared to Australians (P = 0.047). Greater PPBoD was seen in patients with CD and IBDU compared to patients with UC (P < 0.001) and females were more likely to have significant PPBoD (8.7%) than males (6.1%) (P < 0.001). People with no or mild PPBoD were more likely to be on advanced therapies (55.7% and 59.5% respectively) than those with significant PPBoD (46.3%) (P < 0.001). The proportion of people on advanced therapies in Australia was higher than in New Zealand (61.2% vs 38.5% respectively, P < 0.001). Steroid usage was significantly higher in people with greater PPBoD (significant BoD 7.1% vs no BoD 1.1%; P < 0.001).


CONCLUSION
Most of this real-world care cohort had no or mild PPBoD. Data suggest that higher PPBoD levels may be resolved by appropriate therapeutic escalations.">

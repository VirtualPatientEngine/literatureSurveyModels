        <tr id="General and simple principles are identified that govern signal transduction. The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude, duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal −1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF‐induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration. Implications for the cellular decision between growth and differentiation are discussed.">

        <tr id="The Notch, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, and EGF pathways have long been known to influence cell fate specification in the developing nervous system. Here we attempted to evaluate the contemporary knowledge about neural stem cell differentiation promoted by various drug-based regulations through a systems biology approach. Our model showed the phenomenon of DAPT-mediated antagonism of Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes and enhancement of Shh target genes by a SAG agonist that were effectively demonstrated computationally and were consistent with experimental studies. However, in the case of model simulation of Wnt and EGF pathways, the model network did not supply any concurrent results with experimental data despite the fact that drugs were added at the appropriate positions. This paves insight into the potential of crosstalks between pathways considered in our study. Therefore, we manually developed a map of signaling crosstalk, which included the species connected by representatives from Notch, Shh, Wnt, and EGF pathways and highlighted the regulation of a single target gene, Hes-1, based on drug-induced simulations. These simulations provided results that matched with experimental studies. Therefore, these signaling crosstalk models complement as a tool toward the discovery of novel regulatory processes involved in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation during mammalian central nervous system development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a simple crosstalk map that highlights the differential regulation of neural stem cell differentiation and underscores the flow of positive and negative regulatory signals modulated by drugs.">

        <tr id="Relapse and metastasis are the major challenges that stand in the way of cancer healing and survival, mainly attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Their capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenic potential leads to treatment resistance development. CSCs function through signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. While commonly involved in embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis, the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway has direct correlations with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The development of therapies that target CSCs and bulk tumors is both crucial and urgent. However, the extensive crosstalk present between Wnt and other signaling networks (Hedgehog and Notch) complicates the development of efficient long-term therapies with minimal side-effects on normal tissues. Despite the obstacles, the emergence of Wnt inhibitors and subsequent modulation of the signaling pathways would provide dynamic therapeutic approaches to impairing CSCs and reversing resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The complex signaling network within the breast tumor microenvironment is crucial for its growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, therapy escape, stem cell maintenance, and immunomodulation. An array of secretory factors and their receptors activate downstream signaling cascades regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis. Among various signaling pathways, the EGFR, ER, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have recently been identified as crucial in terms of breast cancer proliferation, survival, differentiation, maintenance of CSCs, and therapy failure. These receptors mediate various downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK, including MEK/ERK signaling pathways that promote common pro-oncogenic signaling, whereas dysregulation of PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT activates key oncogenic events such as drug resistance, CSC enrichment, and metabolic reprogramming. Additionally, these cascades orchestrate an intricate interplay between stromal cells, immune cells, and tumor cells. Metabolic reprogramming and adaptations contribute to aggressive breast cancer and are unresponsive to therapy. Herein, recent insights into the novel signaling pathways operating within the breast TME that aid in their advancement are emphasized and current developments in practices targeting the breast TME to enhance treatment efficacy are reviewed.">

Dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways leads to changes in proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis, leading to cancer. This review aims to provide insight into the major three signaling
pathways implicated in cancer development and progression: the Hedgehog (Hh), Phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and Notch pathways. Abnormal activation of the Hedgehog pathway,
which has been linked to several malignancies, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma,
is primarily responsible for controlling the phases of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
The intricate involvement of Hh signaling in cancer stem cell maintenance, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, and tumor microenvironment modulation underscores its significance as a therapeutic
target. Similarly, dysregulation of the PI3K pathway, a crucial mediator of cell growth, survival, and
metabolism, is prevalent across multiple cancer types. Mutations in PI3K pathway components lead
to uncontrolled cell proliferation and evasion of apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic
avenue. Various inhibitors targeting PI3K and its downstream effectors have shown promise in preclinical
and clinical settings. Additionally, the Notch signaling pathway, crucial for cell fate determination
and tissue patterning during development, exhibits dysregulated activity in numerous cancers.
Notch pathway alterations contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, presenting
opportunities for targeted therapies. The review discusses current therapeutic strategies targeting
these pathways, including small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and combination therapies.
Challenges, such as drug resistance and toxicity are addressed, along with emerging therapeutic
approaches to enhance treatment efficacy. In conclusion, understanding the intricate crosstalk and
dysregulation of signaling pathways in cancer provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms
and therapeutic avenues, paving the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.

        <tr id="Cell states evolve through the combined activity of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. While transcription factors can direct cell fate, these factors rely on a cell state that is receptive to transitions in cell identity. How signaling levels contribute to the emergence of receptive cell states remains poorly defined in primary cells. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, we examined how levels of the MAPK-activating oncogene HRASG12V influence direct conversion of primary fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. We demonstrate that an optimal ‘Goldilocks’ level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Rates of direct conversion respond biphasically to increasing HRASG12V levels. While intermediate HRASG12V levels increase the rate of conversion, high levels of HRASG12V induce senescence. Through chemogenetic tuning, we set optimal MAPK activity for high rates of conversion in the absence of HRAS mutants. As MAPK pathways influence cell-fate transitions in development and disease, our results highlight the need to tune therapeutic interventions within a non-monotonic landscape that is shaped by genetics and levels of gene expression. Highlights MAPK signaling drives proliferation and conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons Cell-fate programming responds biphasically to HRASG12V expression High HRASG12V expression induces senescence, which reduces conversion Chemogenetic tuning of MAPK activity increases conversion rates A small-molecule MAPK inducer drives high rates of conversion in the absence of HRASG12V">

        <tr id="The PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling pathways are integral to fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, viability, and differentiation. In granulosa cells (GCs), these pathways are activated by FSH and IGF1 through respective receptors. We investigated the comparative transcriptome changes induced by AKT and ERK pathways using corresponding inhibitors in GCs. GCs isolated from antral follicles showed positive signals for phospho-AKT and -ERK proteins. Treatment of cultured GCs with FSH and IGF1 induced phospho-AKT and -ERK levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1436 genes regulated by AKT and 654 genes regulated by ERK pathway. Among these, 94 genes were commonly downregulated, and 11 genes were commonly upregulated in both data sets, while 110 genes were oppositely regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways downregulates key reproductive processes and upstream molecules. Notably, AKT inhibition affected FSH, ESRRG, and HIF1 pathways, while ERK inhibition impacted CG, FOS, TGFβ, EGR1, and LH pathways. Transcriptome data showed that genes related to estradiol production were inhibited by ERK and induced by the AKT pathway. This was verified by radioimmunoassays, and mRNA and protein analysis of CYP19A1 and STAR genes. In addition, transcriptome data suggested downregulation of glucose metabolism in GCs. Using validation experiments, we confirm that both pathways are essential for glucose uptake, lactate production, and mitochondrial activity in GCs. These data provide a resource for informing future research for analyzing various novel candidate genes regulated by AKT and ERK pathways in GCs and other cell types.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in the medical field in this century, largely due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. Fortunately, recent advancements in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis have helped identify more therapeutic targets for improved treatment outcomes. The WNT signaling pathways are highly conserved cascades that participate in diverse physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. Ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, is driven by lipid peroxidation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Emerging evidence shows that the dysregulation of WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis, as well as their intricate crosstalk, plays crucial roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, indicating their potential as targets for cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the crosstalk between WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer, with a specific focus on the regulatory role of the canonical WNT cascade in cancer-related ferroptosis. In addition, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms of current strategies that inhibit canonical WNT signaling and/or induce ferroptosis in cancer treatment. We propose that combining canonical WNT pathway inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers and current therapies represents a promising therapeutic strategy for personalized cancer treatment.">

The expression of ligands and receptors within the classical and non-classical Wnt signaling pathways plays an important role in HCC. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for regulating multiple biological processes in HCC, including proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor microenvironment modulation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell characteristics, and autophagy. Molecular agents that specifically target the Wnt signaling pathway have demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of HCC. However, the precise mechanism by which the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with HCC remains unclear.

        <tr id="Wnt (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) signaling is an evolutionary conserved system highly active during embryogenesis, but in adult hearts has low activities under normal conditions. It is essential for a variety of physiological processes including stem cell regeneration, proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and morphogenesis, thereby ensuring homeostasis and regeneration of cardiac tissue. Its dysregulation and excessive activation during pathological conditions leads to morphological and functional changes in the heart resulting in impaired myocardial regeneration under pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Several groups of Wnt inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to modulate the Wnt pathway and thereby significantly reduce fibrosis and improve cardiac function after myocardial ischemia. Their inhibitory effect can be realized at multiple levels, which include the inhibition of Wnt ligands, the inhibition of Frizzled receptors, the stabilization of the β-catenin destruction complex, and the disruption of nuclear β-catenin interactions. In this review, we overview the function of Wnt signaling in responses of cardiac cells to pathological conditions, especially ischemic heart disease, with an emphasis on the use of inhibitors of this signaling as a therapeutic approach. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge about the potential of the targeting of Wnt signaling in therapeutic applications.">

Here we modified a previously reported Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe for ERK, EKAREN5 by replacing its mTurquoise2 and YPet sequences with mTurquoise-GL and a synonymous codon variant of YPet, respectively. The modified biosensor, EKAREN5-gl showed an increased sensitivity to EGF-induced ERK activation responding to a very low dose (20 pg/ml) of EGF stimulation. We quantitatively characterized two FRET-based ERK probes, EKAREN5 and EKAREN5-gl, and a subcellular kinase translocation-based probe, ERK-KTR. We found the three biosensors differently respond to EGF stimulations with different intensity, duration, and latency. Furthermore, we investigated how the minimal EGF-induced ERK activation affects the downstream transcription in HeLa cells by comprehensive transcriptional analysis. We found the minimal ERK activation leads to a distinct transcriptional pattern from those induced by higher ERK activations. Our study highlights the significance of sensitive fluorescent probes to understand cellular signal dynamics and the role of minimal ERK activation in regulating transcription.Key words: fluorescent probe, ERK, FRET, KTR.">

The goal of this study is to elucidate the specific function of MKP in the regulation of MAPK signaling and to identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with MAPK dysregulation. In this study, the interaction between MKP and MAPK signaling was investigated using cellular models and biochemical experiments. The primary targets were cells expressing MAPK and MKP, and protein-protein interactions and signaling dynamics were analyzed using methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. According to this study, MKP is crucial for the exact temporal and spatial modulation of MAPK signaling through its negative regulation.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent chronic disease that is becoming increasingly common worldwide and can lead to a number of dangerous complications. The Wnt signaling pathway is important for the onset and progression of diabetes. Wnt3a is a typical Wnt ligand that can increase the stability of β-catenin, control TCF7L2 expression, promote β-cell proliferation, and reduce apoptosis.


SUMMARY
The involvement of the Wnt3a/β-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling pathway in the development of diabetes and associated problems related to the kidneys is reviewed in this article.


KEY MESSAGE
We believe that a thorough comprehension of the molecular connections between diabetes and signaling pathways will eventually lead to improved diabetes management.">

        <tr id="AXIN proteins are major components of the β-catenin destruction complex or degradasome, which limits β-catenin nuclear translocation and Wnt signalling activation at steady state. Schmidt et al. performed quantitative analysis of cellular AXIN protein levels in human colorectal cancer cells and revealed that AXIN2 plays a non-redundant role in regulating the total AXIN pool and Wnt/β-catenin signalling activity. Tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitors failed to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signalling in AXIN2 knockout cells, suggesting that AXIN2 is essential for TNKS inhibitors to function. Mechanistically, the authors show that AXIN2 recruits TNKS to AXIN1 and promotes TNKS-mediated degradation of AXIN1. These findings may have important implications for anti-cancer therapy by TNKS small molecule inhibitors.">

These emergent patterns are controlled by transcription factors and secreted signals that regulate cellular fate and behaviors through intracellular regulatory circuits and cell-cell communication circuits. However, the principles of these circuits and how their properties are combined to provide the spatio-temporal properties of tissues remain unclear. Here we develop a framework to explore building-block circuits of developmental programs. We use single-cell gene expression data across developmental stages of the human intestine to infer the key intra- and inter-cellular circuits that control developmental programs. We study how these circuits are joined into higher-level hyper-motif circuits and explore their emergent dynamical properties. This framework uncovers design principles of developmental programs and reveals the rules that allow cells to develop robust and diverse patterns.">

        <tr id="Cell-to-substrate adhesion sites, also known as focal adhesion sites (FAs), are complexes of different proteins on the cell surface. FAs play important roles in communication between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to signal transduction involving different proteins that ultimately produce the cell response. This cell response involves cell adhesion, migration, motility, cell survival, and cell proliferation. The most important component of FAs are integrins. Integrins are transmembrane proteins that receive signals from the ECM and communicate them to the cytoplasm, thus activating several downstream proteins in a signaling cascade. Cellular Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (c-Src) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that functionally interact to promote crucial roles in FAs. c-Src is a tyrosine kinase, activated by autophosphorylation and, in turn, activates another important protein, FAK. Activated FAK directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin and activates other FA proteins by attaching to them. These proteins activated by FAK then activate other downstream pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, and cell survival. Src can induce detachment of FAK from the integrin to increase the focal adhesion turnover. As a result, the Src-FAK complex in FAs is critical for cell adhesion and survival mechanisms. Overexpression of FA proteins has been linked to a variety of pathological disorders, including cancers, growth retardation, and bone deformities. FAK and Src are overexpressed in various cancers. This review, which focuses on the roles of two important signaling proteins, c-Src and FAK, attempts to provide a thorough and up-to-date examination of the signal transduction mechanisms mediated by focal adhesions. The author also described that FAK and Src may serve as potential targets for future therapies against diseases associated with their overexpression, such as certain types of cancer.">

        <tr id="Animal bodies are equipped to sense injuries and respond, and rapid activation of ERK signaling at wound sites has emerged as a recurring mechanism across metazoans. During whole-body regeneration, distant species including cnidarians, planarians and echinoderms activate ERK at wounds to drive early transcriptional changes. However, it is unclear to what extent these are distinct phenomena, utilizing a common effector pathway but with different upstream inputs and downstream functions, or are more deeply alike, sharing upstream inputs, activating cell type(s), or spatiotemporal dynamics. To facilitate thorough comparisons across animals, we examined wound-induced ERK during whole-body regeneration in the acoel Hofstenia miamia. ERK signaling is induced at wound sites within 10 minutes post-amputation and peaks in activity within one hour. ERK is required for head and tail regeneration and inhibiting ERK suppresses the expression of wound-induced genes, which are themselves required for regeneration. Quantification of spatial dynamics revealed that active ERK spreads rapidly away from the wound site during the first 30 minutes post-amputation and continues to expand in space through 3-6 hours, albeit at lower levels. Multiple cell types activate ERK including neoblasts (stem cells) and muscle, and ERK is spatially dynamic within both cell types, however, ERK activation in muscle does not require neoblasts. Finally, neuregulin-1, a putative ligand produced exclusively by muscle cells, is required for ERK activation at wounds. Altogether, our data identify a key signaling role of muscle cells in driving ERK activation in multiple cell types after injury, and describe a spatial spreading phenomenon with parallels to dynamic ERK patterns in other systems.">

 Alterations in the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade are common across multiple solid tumor types and is a driver for many cancers. NST-628 is a potent pan-RAF-MEK molecular glue that prevents phosphorylation and activation of MEK by RAF, overcoming the limitations of traditional RAS-MAPK inhibitors and leading to deep durable inhibition of the pathway. Cellular, biochemical, and structural analysis of RAF-MEK complexes show that NST-628 engages all isoforms of RAF, including ARAF, and prevents the formation of BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, a differentiated mechanism from all current RAF inhibitors. With a potent and durable inhibition of the RAF-MEK signaling complex as well as high intrinsic permeability into the brain, NST-628 demonstrates broad efficacy in cellular and patient-derived tumor models harboring diverse MAPK pathway alterations, including orthotopic intracranial models. Given a mechanism differentiated from previous therapies targeting RAF or MEK catalytic activity, NST-628 is positioned to make an impact clinically in an areas of unmet patient need.

        <tr id="The Sprouty (SPRY) proteins are evolutionary conserved modulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. SPRY2 inhibits fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, whereas it enhances epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling through inhibition of EGF receptor (EGFR) endocytosis, ubiquitination, and degradation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of SPRY2 on endocytosis and degradation of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) using two human glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines with different endogenous SPRY2 levels. SPRY2 overexpression (SPRY2-OE) inhibited clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis of FGFR1, reduced the number of caveolin-1 vesicles and the uptake of transferrin. Furthermore, FGFR1 protein was decreased by SPRY2-OE, whereas EGFR protein was increased. SPRY2-OE enhanced FGFR1 degradation by increased c-casitas b-lineage lymphoma (c-CBL)-mediated ubiquitination, but it diminished binding of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) to FGFR1. Consequently, SPRY2-OE inhibited FGF2-induced activation of PLCγ1, whereas it enhanced EGF-induced PLCγ1 activation. Despite the reduction of FGFR1 protein and the inhibition of FGF signaling, SPRY2-OE increased cell viability, and knockdown of SPRY2 enhanced the sensitivity to cisplatin. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of SPRY2-OE on FGF signaling is at least in part due to the reduction in FGFR1 levels and the decreased binding of PLCγ1 to the receptor.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates gene expression through two primary mechanisms: as a growth factor in the nucleus, where it translocates upon binding its ligand, or via its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the cytosol, where it modulates key signaling pathways such as RAS/MYC, PI3K, PLCγ, and STAT3. During tumorigenesis, these pathways become deregulated, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, enhanced migratory and metastatic capabilities, evasion of programmed cell death, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The RAS and MYC oncogenes are pivotal in tumorigenesis, driving processes such as resistance to apoptosis, replicative immortality, cellular invasion and metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming. These oncogenes are subject to regulation by a range of epigenetic and post-transcriptional modifications. This review focuses on the deregulation of EGFR, RAS, and MYC expression caused by (epi)genetic alterations and post-translational modifications. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting these regulatory proteins, emphasizing the importance of phenotyping neoplastic tissues to inform the treatment of cancer.">

        <tr id="Understanding how cells migrate following exogenous cues is one of the most fundamental questions for biology, medicine, and bioengineering. Growing evidence shows that electrotaxis, the directed cell migration toward electric potential gradients, represents a precise and programmable method to control cell migration. Most data suggest that the polarization of membrane components and the following downstream signaling are central to electrotaxis. Unfortunately, how these multiple mechanisms coordinate with the motile machinery of the cell to respond to an electric field is still poorly understood. Here, we develop a mechanistic model that explains and recapitulate electrotaxis across different cell types. Using the zebrafish proteome, we identify membrane proteins directly related to migration signaling pathways that polarize anodally and cathodally. Further, we show that simultaneous and asymmetric distribution of charged membrane receptors towards the anode and the cathode establishes multiple cooperative and competing stimuli for downstream signaling pathways. The resulting polarization of signals controls the actomyosin network dynamics, directing the anodal and cathodal migration of the cell. Our theoretical framework rationalizes the physical processes that determine electrotaxis across cell types and provides a physical framework to test multiple electrotactic pathways. These results together show us how to control cell migration to, e.g., enhance, cancel, or switch directed cell migration, which opens up new avenues not only to promote tissue regeneration or arrest tumor progression but also to design better biomimetic-engineered tissue constructs.">

While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal epithelial cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation impairs ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited defective distal appendage formation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicular docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels. Summary This study investigates how modulating Wnt signaling affects ciliogenesis in human retinal epithelial cells, revealing that both excessive and insufficient Wnt activity disrupt cilia formation and highlighting the interplay between Wnt and mTOR signaling in this process.">

        <tr id="A lack of tools for detecting receptor activity in vivo has limited our ability to fully explore receptor-level control of developmental patterning. Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.">

        <tr id="Self-organization, such as the emergence of a pattern from a homogenous state, is a fascinating property of biological systems. Early limb bud outgrowth and patterning in mice are controlled by a robust and self-regulatory signaling system, and initiation of the periodic digit-interdigit pattern appears under control of a self-regulatory Turing system. Previous studies established the requirement of WNT and BMP signaling for both early limb bud and digit-interdigit morphogenesis, but the molecular changes underlying the transition from early limb bud signaling to the digit-interdigit patterning system remained unknown. Here, we use small molecule inhibitors to rapidly but transiently block WNT signaling to identify the early transcriptional targets that are altered during disruption and recovery of limb bud and digit development. Together, this study highlights the overarching role of WNT signaling in controlling early limb bud outgrowth and patterning, and establishment of the periodic digit-interdigit pattern. Finally, the transient WNT signaling disruption approach reveals the plasticity and robustness of these self-organizing limb bud and digit patterning systems. Summary Statement It was unknown how the signaling system controlling early limb bud development transitions to the periodic digit-interdigit patterning system. We show that WNT signaling controls this transition as an integral part of both signalling systems.">

        <tr id="Resistance to BRAF and MAPK inhibitors is a significant challenge in melanoma treatment, driven by adaptive and acquired mechanisms that allow tumour cells to evade therapy. Here, we examined early signalling responses to single and combined BRAF and MAPK inhibition in a BRAFV600E, drug-sensitive melanoma cell line and a drug-resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) derivative. ARID1A, frequently mutated in melanoma, is associated with resistance and immune evasion. Using an innovative systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and functional kinomics through matrix factorization and network analysis, we identified key signalling alterations and resistance mechanisms. We found that ARID1A-KO cells exhibited transcriptional rewiring, sustaining MAPK1/3 and JNK activity post-treatment, bypassing feedback sensitivity observed in parental cells. This rewiring suppressed PRKD1 activation, increased JUN activity—a central resistance network node—and disrupted PKC dynamics through elevated basal RTKs (e.g., EGFR, ROS1) and Ephrin receptor activity post-treatment. ARID1A mutations also reduced HLA-related protein expression and enriched extracellular matrix components, potentially limiting immune infiltration and reducing immunotherapy efficacy. Our graph-theoretical multi-omics approach uncovered novel resistance-associated signalling pathways, identifying PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1 as critical nodes. While receptor activation redundancies complicate single-target therapies, they also present opportunities for combination strategies. This study highlights ARID1A’s role in reshaping signalling and immune interactions, offering new insights into melanoma resistance mechanisms. By identifying actionable targets, including JUN and immune pathways, we provide a foundation for developing integrated therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in BRAF/MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma. One sentence summary This study reveals how ARID1A-mediated transcriptional rewiring drives resistance to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma by altering signalling pathways, immune interactions, and receptor dynamics, highlighting potential targets for combinatorial therapies.">

        <tr id="KRAS was long deemed undruggable until the discovery of the switch-II pocket facilitated the development of specific KRAS inhibitors. Despite their introduction into clinical practice, resistance mechanisms can limit their effectiveness. Initially, tumors rely on mutant KRAS, but as they progress, they may shift to alternative pathways, resulting in intrinsic resistance. This resistance can stem from mechanisms like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), YAP activation, or KEAP1 mutations. KRAS inhibition often triggers cellular rewiring to counteract therapeutic pressure. For instance, feedback reactivation of signaling pathways such as MAPK, mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, supports tumor cell survival. Inhibiting KRAS disrupts protein homeostasis, but reactivation of MAPK or AKT can restore it, aiding tumor cell survival. KRAS inhibition also causes metabolic reprogramming and protein re-localization. The re-localization of E-cadherin and Scribble from the membrane to the cytosol causes YAP to translocate to the nucleus, where it drives MRAS transcription, leading to MAPK reactivation. Emerging evidence indicates that changes in cell identity, such as mucinous differentiation, shifts from alveolar type 2 to type 1 cells, or lineage switching from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma, also contribute to resistance. In addition to these nongenetic mechanisms, secondary mutations in KRAS or alterations in upstream/downstream signaling proteins can cause acquired resistance. Secondary mutations in the switch-II pocket disrupt drug binding, and known oncogenic mutations affect drug efficacy. Overcoming these resistance mechanisms involves enhancing the efficacy of drugs targeting mutant KRAS, developing broad-spectrum inhibitors, combining therapies targeting multiple pathways, and integrating immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Background Previously we found that increasing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the neural crest cells within the frontonasal process (FNP) of the chicken embryo caused dysmorphology that was correlated with reduced proliferation, disrupted cellular orientation, and lower MAPK activation but no change in PLCy and PI3K activation. This suggests RTK signaling may drive craniofacial morphogenesis through specific downstream effectors that affect cellular activities. In this study we inhibited three downstream branches of RTK signaling to determine their role in regulating cellular activities and how these changes affect morphogenesis of the FNP. Results Small molecule inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3K, and PLCy were delivered individually and in tandem to the right FNP of chicken embryos. All treatments caused asymmetric proximodistal truncation on the treated side and a mild expansion on the untreated side compared to DMSO control treated FNPs. Inhibiting each pathway caused similar decreased proliferation and disrupted cellular orientation, but did not affect apoptosis. Conclusions Since RTK signaling is a ubiquitous and tightly regulated biochemical system we conclude that the downstream pathways are robust to developmental perturbation through redundant signaling systems. Bullet points Inhibiting three downstream effectors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (MEK1/2, PLCy, and PI3K) in the frontonasal process of chicken embryos caused similar mild truncation of growth. Combining all three inhibitors had a slightly stronger effect on truncation. Individual inhibitors did not have specific effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, or cellular orientation. The downstream branches of RTK signaling likely have shared interdependent effects on cellular activities that contribute to morphogenesis.">

        <tr id="Defects in cranial neural tube closure are among the most common and deleterious human structural birth defects. Correct cranial closure requires the coordination of multiple cell dynamic programs including cell proliferation and cell shape change. Mutations that impact Wnt signaling, including loss of the pathway co-receptor LRP6, lead to defects in cranial neural tube closure indicating that this pathway is an important mediator of this critical morphogenetic event, but the cellular dynamics under control of the Wnt pathway during closure remain unclear. Here, we use mice mutant for LRP6 to examine the consequences of conditional and global reduction in Wnt signaling, as well as conditional inactivation of APC to examine the consequences of pathway hyperactivation. Strikingly, we find that regulated Wnt signaling is required for two independent events during cranial neural tube closure. First, global reduction of Wnt leads to a surprising hyperplasia of the cranial neural folds driven by excessive cell proliferation at early pre-elevation stages. The increased tissue volume presents a mechanical blockade to efficient closure despite normal apical constriction and cell polarization at later stages. Conversely, conditional hyperactivation of the pathway at elevation stages prevents apical constriction and neural fold elevation but has no impact on cell polarization or proliferation. Together these data reveal that Wnt signaling levels must be modulated to restrict proliferation at early stages and allow for apical constriction later at elevation stages to promote efficient closure of the cranial neural tube.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment aids cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks, independent of cancer-related mutations. Biophysical properties of this environment, such as the stiffness of the matrix cells adhere to and local cell density, impact proliferation, apoptosis, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The latter is rate-limiting step for invasion and metastasis, enhanced in hypoxic tumor environments but hindered by soft matrices and/or high cell densities. As these influences are often studied in isolation, the crosstalk between hypoxia, biomechanical signals, and the classic EMT driver TGF-β is not well mapped, limiting our ability to predict and anticipate cancer cell behaviors in changing tumor environments. To address this, we built a Boolean regulatory network model that integrates hypoxic signaling with a mechanosensitive model of EMT, which includes the EMT-promoting crosstalk of mitogens and biomechanical signals, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Our model reproduces the requirement of Hif-1α for proliferation, the anti-proliferative effects of strong Hif-1α stabilization during hypoxia, hypoxic protection from anoikis, and hypoxia-driven mechanosensitive EMT. We offer experimentally testable predictions about the effect of VHL loss on cancer hallmarks, with or without secondary oncogene activation. Taken together, our model serves as a predictive framework to synthesize the signaling responses associated with tumor progression and metastasis in healthy vs. mutant cells. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive regulatory network models that cover damage-response and senescence, integrating most cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks into a single model that can, in turn, control the behavior of in silico cells within a tissue model of epithelial homeostasis and carcinoma. Author Summary The cellular environment in and around a tumor can aid cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks. This environment can affect growth and cell death, as well as a phenotype change that renders cells migratory and invasive: the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Hypoxia (low oxygen availability) is known to promote this transition, while the attachment of cells to soft matrices or high cell density environments hinders it. These influences are often studied in isolation. As a result, their crosstalk is poorly understood. To address this, we have built a network model of cellular regulation that integrates a cell’s responses to hypoxia, the biophysical environment, and growth signals to model cell division, death, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in environments cells encounter during metastatic tumor progression. Our model reproduces a wide range of experimental cell responses and offers experimentally testable predictions about the emergence of cancer hallmarks driven mutations that affect the hypoxic response. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive cell-scale models that also include cell aging and damage response. These, in turn, can serve as building blocks of a larger tissue model of healthy vs. cancerous epithelia.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The Hippo signaling governs the expression of genes critically important for cell proliferation and survival. The components of this pathway are considered antitumor drug targets. However, the design of Hippo inhibitors is a challenge given the complexity of the network and redundancy of its elements.


AREAS COVERED
We review the current state-of-the-art in the structure of the Hippo pathway, the microenvironment-induced extracellular cues, the strategies to design pharmacological instruments for inactivation of the Hippo signaling using small molecular weight modulators, as well as the results of initial clinical trials.


EXPERT OPINION
One special characteristic of the Hippo signaling is the adverse role of phosphorylation: opposite to classical kinase cascades that activate the transcription factors, the Hippo kinases retain their partners in a transcriptionally inactive state. Therefore, approaches for pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Hippo protein kinases are counterproductive. The developing alternatives such as disruption of protein-protein interactions or PROTAC techniques are straightforward for preventing the Hippo signaling in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="General and simple principles are identified that govern signal transduction. The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude, duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal −1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF‐induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration. Implications for the cellular decision between growth and differentiation are discussed.">

        <tr id="The Notch, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, and EGF pathways have long been known to influence cell fate specification in the developing nervous system. Here we attempted to evaluate the contemporary knowledge about neural stem cell differentiation promoted by various drug-based regulations through a systems biology approach. Our model showed the phenomenon of DAPT-mediated antagonism of Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes and enhancement of Shh target genes by a SAG agonist that were effectively demonstrated computationally and were consistent with experimental studies. However, in the case of model simulation of Wnt and EGF pathways, the model network did not supply any concurrent results with experimental data despite the fact that drugs were added at the appropriate positions. This paves insight into the potential of crosstalks between pathways considered in our study. Therefore, we manually developed a map of signaling crosstalk, which included the species connected by representatives from Notch, Shh, Wnt, and EGF pathways and highlighted the regulation of a single target gene, Hes-1, based on drug-induced simulations. These simulations provided results that matched with experimental studies. Therefore, these signaling crosstalk models complement as a tool toward the discovery of novel regulatory processes involved in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation during mammalian central nervous system development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a simple crosstalk map that highlights the differential regulation of neural stem cell differentiation and underscores the flow of positive and negative regulatory signals modulated by drugs.">

        <tr id="Relapse and metastasis are the major challenges that stand in the way of cancer healing and survival, mainly attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Their capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenic potential leads to treatment resistance development. CSCs function through signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. While commonly involved in embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis, the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway has direct correlations with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The development of therapies that target CSCs and bulk tumors is both crucial and urgent. However, the extensive crosstalk present between Wnt and other signaling networks (Hedgehog and Notch) complicates the development of efficient long-term therapies with minimal side-effects on normal tissues. Despite the obstacles, the emergence of Wnt inhibitors and subsequent modulation of the signaling pathways would provide dynamic therapeutic approaches to impairing CSCs and reversing resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The complex signaling network within the breast tumor microenvironment is crucial for its growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, therapy escape, stem cell maintenance, and immunomodulation. An array of secretory factors and their receptors activate downstream signaling cascades regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis. Among various signaling pathways, the EGFR, ER, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have recently been identified as crucial in terms of breast cancer proliferation, survival, differentiation, maintenance of CSCs, and therapy failure. These receptors mediate various downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK, including MEK/ERK signaling pathways that promote common pro-oncogenic signaling, whereas dysregulation of PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT activates key oncogenic events such as drug resistance, CSC enrichment, and metabolic reprogramming. Additionally, these cascades orchestrate an intricate interplay between stromal cells, immune cells, and tumor cells. Metabolic reprogramming and adaptations contribute to aggressive breast cancer and are unresponsive to therapy. Herein, recent insights into the novel signaling pathways operating within the breast TME that aid in their advancement are emphasized and current developments in practices targeting the breast TME to enhance treatment efficacy are reviewed.">

Dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways leads to changes in proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis, leading to cancer. This review aims to provide insight into the major three signaling
pathways implicated in cancer development and progression: the Hedgehog (Hh), Phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and Notch pathways. Abnormal activation of the Hedgehog pathway,
which has been linked to several malignancies, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma,
is primarily responsible for controlling the phases of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
The intricate involvement of Hh signaling in cancer stem cell maintenance, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, and tumor microenvironment modulation underscores its significance as a therapeutic
target. Similarly, dysregulation of the PI3K pathway, a crucial mediator of cell growth, survival, and
metabolism, is prevalent across multiple cancer types. Mutations in PI3K pathway components lead
to uncontrolled cell proliferation and evasion of apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic
avenue. Various inhibitors targeting PI3K and its downstream effectors have shown promise in preclinical
and clinical settings. Additionally, the Notch signaling pathway, crucial for cell fate determination
and tissue patterning during development, exhibits dysregulated activity in numerous cancers.
Notch pathway alterations contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, presenting
opportunities for targeted therapies. The review discusses current therapeutic strategies targeting
these pathways, including small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and combination therapies.
Challenges, such as drug resistance and toxicity are addressed, along with emerging therapeutic
approaches to enhance treatment efficacy. In conclusion, understanding the intricate crosstalk and
dysregulation of signaling pathways in cancer provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms
and therapeutic avenues, paving the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.

        <tr id="Cell states evolve through the combined activity of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. While transcription factors can direct cell fate, these factors rely on a cell state that is receptive to transitions in cell identity. How signaling levels contribute to the emergence of receptive cell states remains poorly defined in primary cells. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, we examined how levels of the MAPK-activating oncogene HRASG12V influence direct conversion of primary fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. We demonstrate that an optimal ‘Goldilocks’ level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Rates of direct conversion respond biphasically to increasing HRASG12V levels. While intermediate HRASG12V levels increase the rate of conversion, high levels of HRASG12V induce senescence. Through chemogenetic tuning, we set optimal MAPK activity for high rates of conversion in the absence of HRAS mutants. As MAPK pathways influence cell-fate transitions in development and disease, our results highlight the need to tune therapeutic interventions within a non-monotonic landscape that is shaped by genetics and levels of gene expression. Highlights MAPK signaling drives proliferation and conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons Cell-fate programming responds biphasically to HRASG12V expression High HRASG12V expression induces senescence, which reduces conversion Chemogenetic tuning of MAPK activity increases conversion rates A small-molecule MAPK inducer drives high rates of conversion in the absence of HRASG12V">

        <tr id="The PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling pathways are integral to fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, viability, and differentiation. In granulosa cells (GCs), these pathways are activated by FSH and IGF1 through respective receptors. We investigated the comparative transcriptome changes induced by AKT and ERK pathways using corresponding inhibitors in GCs. GCs isolated from antral follicles showed positive signals for phospho-AKT and -ERK proteins. Treatment of cultured GCs with FSH and IGF1 induced phospho-AKT and -ERK levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1436 genes regulated by AKT and 654 genes regulated by ERK pathway. Among these, 94 genes were commonly downregulated, and 11 genes were commonly upregulated in both data sets, while 110 genes were oppositely regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways downregulates key reproductive processes and upstream molecules. Notably, AKT inhibition affected FSH, ESRRG, and HIF1 pathways, while ERK inhibition impacted CG, FOS, TGFβ, EGR1, and LH pathways. Transcriptome data showed that genes related to estradiol production were inhibited by ERK and induced by the AKT pathway. This was verified by radioimmunoassays, and mRNA and protein analysis of CYP19A1 and STAR genes. In addition, transcriptome data suggested downregulation of glucose metabolism in GCs. Using validation experiments, we confirm that both pathways are essential for glucose uptake, lactate production, and mitochondrial activity in GCs. These data provide a resource for informing future research for analyzing various novel candidate genes regulated by AKT and ERK pathways in GCs and other cell types.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in the medical field in this century, largely due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. Fortunately, recent advancements in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis have helped identify more therapeutic targets for improved treatment outcomes. The WNT signaling pathways are highly conserved cascades that participate in diverse physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. Ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, is driven by lipid peroxidation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Emerging evidence shows that the dysregulation of WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis, as well as their intricate crosstalk, plays crucial roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, indicating their potential as targets for cancer therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the crosstalk between WNT signaling pathways and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer, with a specific focus on the regulatory role of the canonical WNT cascade in cancer-related ferroptosis. In addition, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms of current strategies that inhibit canonical WNT signaling and/or induce ferroptosis in cancer treatment. We propose that combining canonical WNT pathway inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers and current therapies represents a promising therapeutic strategy for personalized cancer treatment.">

The expression of ligands and receptors within the classical and non-classical Wnt signaling pathways plays an important role in HCC. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for regulating multiple biological processes in HCC, including proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor microenvironment modulation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell characteristics, and autophagy. Molecular agents that specifically target the Wnt signaling pathway have demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of HCC. However, the precise mechanism by which the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with HCC remains unclear. In this paper, we review the alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC, the mechanism of Wnt pathway action in HCC, and molecular agents targeting the Wnt pathway.

        <tr id="Wnt (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) signaling is an evolutionary conserved system highly active during embryogenesis, but in adult hearts has low activities under normal conditions. It is essential for a variety of physiological processes including stem cell regeneration, proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and morphogenesis, thereby ensuring homeostasis and regeneration of cardiac tissue. Its dysregulation and excessive activation during pathological conditions leads to morphological and functional changes in the heart resulting in impaired myocardial regeneration under pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Several groups of Wnt inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to modulate the Wnt pathway and thereby significantly reduce fibrosis and improve cardiac function after myocardial ischemia. Their inhibitory effect can be realized at multiple levels, which include the inhibition of Wnt ligands, the inhibition of Frizzled receptors, the stabilization of the β-catenin destruction complex, and the disruption of nuclear β-catenin interactions. In this review, we overview the function of Wnt signaling in responses of cardiac cells to pathological conditions, especially ischemic heart disease, with an emphasis on the use of inhibitors of this signaling as a therapeutic approach. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge about the potential of the targeting of Wnt signaling in therapeutic applications.">

One of the most important players of this highly regulated network is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with a significant role in human health and disease. The critical co-receptor of this pathway, LRP6, is overexpressed in various cancer types and is a target for therapy. Therefore, understanding the details of the LRP6 structural activation mechanism is of tremendous importance. This research intended to compare the structural-dynamics features of the E3E4 functional domain of LRP6 induced by the activator Wnt3a and the inhibitor, Dkk1_C, compared with the receptor behavior in the apo-state. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and G_MMPBSA calculation, we characterized overlapping binding regions of Wnt3a and Dkk1_C on E3E4. Despite their overall similar interacting regions, Dkk1_C and Wnt induce remarkably different inter-blades hydrogen bonds, structural-dynamics behavior, and conformational energy landscape in E3E4. According to our findings, Dkk1_C stabilized the interaction. between BP3 blades 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 and BP4 blades 1-6, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4, aligned with apo-state. However, on the other hand, Wnt distinguishably destabilized the hydrogen bond networks of these blades. Our DCCM analysis also depicted a similar correlation pattern of apo and Dkk1-bound states, and dramatic differences in Wnt-bound state, with a specific enhancement of correlated movements in EGF4. These data provide atomistic-level clues of how natural regulators of Wnt signaling manipulate LRP6 dynamics and, therefore, guide the structure-based design of efficient artificial inhibitors/activators for the pathway.">

        <tr id="Placental development is a multifaceted process critical for a fruitful pregnancy, reinforced by a complex network of molecular pathways that synchronize trophoblast migration, differentiation, and overall placental function. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the key signaling pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, TGF-β, and VEGF, which play fundamental roles in trophoblast proliferation, invasion, and the complicated process of placental vascular development. For instance, the Wnt signaling pathway is essential to balance trophoblast stem cell proliferation and differentiation, while Notch signaling stimulates cell fate decisions and invasive behavior. TGF-β signaling plays a critical role in trophoblast invasion and differentiation, predominantly in response to the low oxygen environment of early pregnancy, regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). These factors promote trophoblast adaptation, ensure proper placental attachment and vascularization, and facilitate adequate fetal-maternal exchange. Further, we explore the epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that regulate trophoblast function, including DNA methylation and the contribution of non-coding RNAs, which contribute to the fine-tuning of gene expression during placental development. Dysregulation of these pathways is associated with severe pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and recurrent miscarriage, emphasizing the critical need for targeted therapeutic strategies. Finally, emerging technologies like trophoblast organoids, single-cell RNA sequencing, and placenta-on-chip models are discussed as innovative tools that hold promise for advancing our understanding of placental biology and developing novel interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes. This review emphasizes the importance of understanding these molecular mechanisms to better address placental dysfunctions and associated pregnancy disorders.">

The goal of this study is to elucidate the specific function of MKP in the regulation of MAPK signaling and to identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with MAPK dysregulation. In this study, the interaction between MKP and MAPK signaling was investigated using cellular models and biochemical experiments. The primary targets were cells expressing MAPK and MKP, and protein-protein interactions and signaling dynamics were analyzed using methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. According to this study, MKP is crucial for the exact temporal and spatial modulation of MAPK signaling through its negative regulation.

        <tr id="Skin, as the body's largest organ, acts as the primary defense mechanism against infection and injury. The maintenance of skin health heavily relies on the regulation of epidermal stem cells, crucial for ensuring epidermal homeostasis, hair regeneration, and the repair of epidermal injuries. Recent studies have placed a growing emphasis on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the context of understanding epidermal stem cells, uncovering its significant role in determining their fate. The activation of GPCR triggers the subsequent dissociation of the βγ subunits from the α subunit of G protein, leading to the modulation of various downstream signaling pathways, such as the WNT-BMP signaling crosstalk and the Gαs-PKA signaling pathway. These pathways collectively influence the fate of epidermal stem cells. Consequently, targeted GPCR therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for improving skin health by orchestrating the fate of epidermal stem cells, unveiling potential therapeutic targets that demand further investigation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is a critical regulator of microglial phenotype, including phagocytic function, cytokine expression, and motility, among others. Importantly, both canonical and non-canonical MAPK signaling is directly activated by RTKs, including Interestingly, CSF1R, is activated by two agonists, CSF1 and IL-34, which have been shown to activate the receptor in different ways that can lead to However, little is known about how the affect microglial MAPK signaling, and whether their effects are dependent on disease state/Aβ exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that IL-34 and CSF-1 elicit distinct patterns of MAPK signaling activation in microglia and MAPK activation would be dependent on whether the cells were exposed to Aβ.


METHOD
We applied agonists of CSF1R (i.e., IL-34, CSF1) to the mouse microglial cell (MMC) line, either pre-treated with 500nM of Aβ1-42 or vehicle (1% NH4OH) for 48hr. Cells were serum starved (1hr), stimulated with each agonist for 5min, then lysed for Luminex quantification of a panel of 10 MAPK phosphoproteins.


RESULT
In the absence of Aβ1-42, both CSF1R and IL-34 stimulated both canonical (ERK) and non-canonical (p38, JNK) MAPK signaling phospho-proteins (Wilcox test, p<0.05 vs control). While Aβ1-42 pre-treatment resulted in diminished activation in canonical MAPK signaling (i.e., MEK, ERK) following either CSF1 or IL-34 stimulation, CSF1 stimulation of non-canonical MAPK signaling through p38 and JNK was preserved with Aβ1-42 pre-treatment. These findings indicate that CSF1-induced signaling is robust regardless of Aβ1-42 exposure. Furthermore, different agonists of the same receptor distinctly activate non-canonical MAPK pathway signaling (p38). Collectively, this finding supports the overall hypothesis that CSF-1R-induced signaling is dependent on Aβ and Aβ pre-treatments shift the canonical ERK signaling to non-canonical p38 signaling.


CONCLUSION
These findings show that different agonists of CSF1R can provoke distinct profiles of canonical and non-canonical MAPK pathway signaling in the presence of Aβ1-42. Understanding differences in agonist-specific microglial signaling in healthy and diseased microglia will be essential to designing microglial-targeted therapeutics for treatment of AD.">

Tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitors failed to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signalling in AXIN2 knockout cells, suggesting that AXIN2 is essential for TNKS inhibitors to function.

        <tr id="Animal bodies are equipped to sense injuries and respond, and rapid activation of ERK signaling at wound sites has emerged as a recurring mechanism across metazoans. During whole-body regeneration, distant species including cnidarians, planarians and echinoderms activate ERK at wounds to drive early transcriptional changes. However, it is unclear to what extent these are distinct phenomena, utilizing a common effector pathway but with different upstream inputs and downstream functions, or are more deeply alike, sharing upstream inputs, activating cell type(s), or spatiotemporal dynamics. To facilitate thorough comparisons across animals, we examined wound-induced ERK during whole-body regeneration in the acoel Hofstenia miamia. ERK signaling is induced at wound sites within 10 minutes post-amputation and peaks in activity within one hour. ERK is required for head and tail regeneration and inhibiting ERK suppresses the expression of wound-induced genes, which are themselves required for regeneration. Quantification of spatial dynamics revealed that active ERK spreads rapidly away from the wound site during the first 30 minutes post-amputation and continues to expand in space through 3-6 hours, albeit at lower levels. Multiple cell types activate ERK including neoblasts (stem cells) and muscle, and ERK is spatially dynamic within both cell types, however, ERK activation in muscle does not require neoblasts. Finally, neuregulin-1, a putative ligand produced exclusively by muscle cells, is required for ERK activation at wounds. Altogether, our data identify a key signaling role of muscle cells in driving ERK activation in multiple cell types after injury, and describe a spatial spreading phenomenon with parallels to dynamic ERK patterns in other systems.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates gene expression through two primary mechanisms: as a growth factor in the nucleus, where it translocates upon binding its ligand, or via its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the cytosol, where it modulates key signaling pathways such as RAS/MYC, PI3K, PLCγ, and STAT3. During tumorigenesis, these pathways become deregulated, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, enhanced migratory and metastatic capabilities, evasion of programmed cell death, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The RAS and MYC oncogenes are pivotal in tumorigenesis, driving processes such as resistance to apoptosis, replicative immortality, cellular invasion and metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming. These oncogenes are subject to regulation by a range of epigenetic and post-transcriptional modifications. This review focuses on the deregulation of EGFR, RAS, and MYC expression caused by (epi)genetic alterations and post-translational modifications. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting these regulatory proteins, emphasizing the importance of phenotyping neoplastic tissues to inform the treatment of cancer.">

        <tr id="Understanding how cells migrate following exogenous cues is one of the most fundamental questions for biology, medicine, and bioengineering. Growing evidence shows that electrotaxis, the directed cell migration toward electric potential gradients, represents a precise and programmable method to control cell migration. Most data suggest that the polarization of membrane components and the following downstream signaling are central to electrotaxis. Unfortunately, how these multiple mechanisms coordinate with the motile machinery of the cell to respond to an electric field is still poorly understood. Here, we develop a mechanistic model that explains and recapitulate electrotaxis across different cell types. Using the zebrafish proteome, we identify membrane proteins directly related to migration signaling pathways that polarize anodally and cathodally. Further, we show that simultaneous and asymmetric distribution of charged membrane receptors towards the anode and the cathode establishes multiple cooperative and competing stimuli for downstream signaling pathways. The resulting polarization of signals controls the actomyosin network dynamics, directing the anodal and cathodal migration of the cell. Our theoretical framework rationalizes the physical processes that determine electrotaxis across cell types and provides a physical framework to test multiple electrotactic pathways. These results together show us how to control cell migration to, e.g., enhance, cancel, or switch directed cell migration, which opens up new avenues not only to promote tissue regeneration or arrest tumor progression but also to design better biomimetic-engineered tissue constructs.">

While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal epithelial cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation impairs ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited defective distal appendage formation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicular docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels. Summary This study investigates how modulating Wnt signaling affects ciliogenesis in human retinal epithelial cells, revealing that both excessive and insufficient Wnt activity disrupt cilia formation and highlighting the interplay between Wnt and mTOR signaling in this process.">

Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.">

        <tr id="Self-organization, such as the emergence of a pattern from a homogenous state, is a fascinating property of biological systems. Early limb bud outgrowth and patterning in mice are controlled by a robust and self-regulatory signaling system, and initiation of the periodic digit-interdigit pattern appears under control of a self-regulatory Turing system. Previous studies established the requirement of WNT and BMP signaling for both early limb bud and digit-interdigit morphogenesis, but the molecular changes underlying the transition from early limb bud signaling to the digit-interdigit patterning system remained unknown. Here, we use small molecule inhibitors to rapidly but transiently block WNT signaling to identify the early transcriptional targets that are altered during disruption and recovery of limb bud and digit development. Together, this study highlights the overarching role of WNT signaling in controlling early limb bud outgrowth and patterning, and establishment of the periodic digit-interdigit pattern. Finally, the transient WNT signaling disruption approach reveals the plasticity and robustness of these self-organizing limb bud and digit patterning systems. Summary Statement It was unknown how the signaling system controlling early limb bud development transitions to the periodic digit-interdigit patterning system. We show that WNT signaling controls this transition as an integral part of both signalling systems.">

        <tr id="Neurodevelopment encompasses a complex series of molecular events occuring at defined time points distinguishable by the specific genetic readout and active protein machinery. Due to immense intricacy of intertwined molecular pathways, extracting and describing all the components of a single pathway is a demanding task. In other words, there is always a risk of leaving potential transient molecular partners unnoticed while investigating signaling cascades with core functions—and the very neglected ones could be the turning point in understanding the context and regulation of the signaling events. For example, signaling pathways of Notch and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been so far unrelated in the vast body of knowledge about neurodevelopment, however evidence from available literature points to their remarkable overlap in influence on identical molecular processes and reveals their potential functional links. Based on data demonstrating Notch and TLR structural engagement and functions during neurodevelopment, along with our description of novel molecular binding models, here we hypothesize that TLR proteins act as likely crucial components in the Notch signaling cascade. We advocate for the hypothesized role of TLRs in Notch signaling by: elaborating components and features of their pathways; reviewing their effects on fates of neural progenitor cells during neurodevelopment; proposing molecular and functional aspects of the hypothesis, along with venues for testing it. Finally, we discuss substantial indications of environmental influence on the proposed Notch-TLR system and its impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.">

        <tr id="The integration between the tumor-suppressive and oncogenic signaling pathways controls various cellular activities of cancer cells, including cell growth and apoptosis. While the activation of oncogenes fuels cancer progression and escape mechanisms, tumor suppressors regulate and counterbalance the negative effects of oncogenic signaling. Notably, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) constitute one of the important family members of tumor suppressor genes, which play critical roles in regulating the activities of tumor cells. Thus, an impaired, mutated, or loss of PTEN is associated with low survival or high tumor recurrence rates in cancer patients. Importantly, high tumor expression of a G-protein coupled platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAFR) is associated with increased tumor progression as well as decreased overall survival and poor prognosis in malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Along similar lines, overactivation or mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling are detected in various human malignancies and associated with poor prognosis. The goal of the current minireview was to highlight the significance of the mechanistic insights between the PTEN and PAFR as well as the PAFR and EGFR pathways in impacting cancer growth and/or efficacy of therapeutic agents in experimental model systems.">

        <tr id="Resistance to BRAF and MAPK inhibitors is a significant challenge in melanoma treatment, driven by adaptive and acquired mechanisms that allow tumour cells to evade therapy. Here, we examined early signalling responses to single and combined BRAF and MAPK inhibition in a BRAFV600E, drug-sensitive melanoma cell line and a drug-resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) derivative. ARID1A, frequently mutated in melanoma, is associated with resistance and immune evasion. Using an innovative systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and functional kinomics through matrix factorization and network analysis, we identified key signalling alterations and resistance mechanisms. We found that ARID1A-KO cells exhibited transcriptional rewiring, sustaining MAPK1/3 and JNK activity post-treatment, bypassing feedback sensitivity observed in parental cells. This rewiring suppressed PRKD1 activation, increased JUN activity—a central resistance network node—and disrupted PKC dynamics through elevated basal RTKs (e.g., EGFR, ROS1) and Ephrin receptor activity post-treatment. ARID1A mutations also reduced HLA-related protein expression and enriched extracellular matrix components, potentially limiting immune infiltration and reducing immunotherapy efficacy. Our graph-theoretical multi-omics approach uncovered novel resistance-associated signalling pathways, identifying PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1 as critical nodes. While receptor activation redundancies complicate single-target therapies, they also present opportunities for combination strategies. This study highlights ARID1A’s role in reshaping signalling and immune interactions, offering new insights into melanoma resistance mechanisms. By identifying actionable targets, including JUN and immune pathways, we provide a foundation for developing integrated therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in BRAF/MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma. One sentence summary This study reveals how ARID1A-mediated transcriptional rewiring drives resistance to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma by altering signalling pathways, immune interactions, and receptor dynamics, highlighting potential targets for combinatorial therapies.">

        <tr id="KRAS was long deemed undruggable until the discovery of the switch-II pocket facilitated the development of specific KRAS inhibitors. Despite their introduction into clinical practice, resistance mechanisms can limit their effectiveness. Initially, tumors rely on mutant KRAS, but as they progress, they may shift to alternative pathways, resulting in intrinsic resistance. This resistance can stem from mechanisms like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), YAP activation, or KEAP1 mutations. KRAS inhibition often triggers cellular rewiring to counteract therapeutic pressure. For instance, feedback reactivation of signaling pathways such as MAPK, mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, supports tumor cell survival. Inhibiting KRAS disrupts protein homeostasis, but reactivation of MAPK or AKT can restore it, aiding tumor cell survival. KRAS inhibition also causes metabolic reprogramming and protein re-localization. The re-localization of E-cadherin and Scribble from the membrane to the cytosol causes YAP to translocate to the nucleus, where it drives MRAS transcription, leading to MAPK reactivation. Emerging evidence indicates that changes in cell identity, such as mucinous differentiation, shifts from alveolar type 2 to type 1 cells, or lineage switching from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma, also contribute to resistance. In addition to these nongenetic mechanisms, secondary mutations in KRAS or alterations in upstream/downstream signaling proteins can cause acquired resistance. Secondary mutations in the switch-II pocket disrupt drug binding, and known oncogenic mutations affect drug efficacy. Overcoming these resistance mechanisms involves enhancing the efficacy of drugs targeting mutant KRAS, developing broad-spectrum inhibitors, combining therapies targeting multiple pathways, and integrating immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Background Previously we found that increasing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the neural crest cells within the frontonasal process (FNP) of the chicken embryo caused dysmorphology that was correlated with reduced proliferation, disrupted cellular orientation, and lower MAPK activation but no change in PLCy and PI3K activation. This suggests RTK signaling may drive craniofacial morphogenesis through specific downstream effectors that affect cellular activities. In this study we inhibited three downstream branches of RTK signaling to determine their role in regulating cellular activities and how these changes affect morphogenesis of the FNP. Results Small molecule inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3K, and PLCy were delivered individually and in tandem to the right FNP of chicken embryos. All treatments caused asymmetric proximodistal truncation on the treated side and a mild expansion on the untreated side compared to DMSO control treated FNPs. Inhibiting each pathway caused similar decreased proliferation and disrupted cellular orientation, but did not affect apoptosis. Conclusions Since RTK signaling is a ubiquitous and tightly regulated biochemical system we conclude that the downstream pathways are robust to developmental perturbation through redundant signaling systems. Bullet points Inhibiting three downstream effectors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (MEK1/2, PLCy, and PI3K) in the frontonasal process of chicken embryos caused similar mild truncation of growth. Combining all three inhibitors had a slightly stronger effect on truncation. Individual inhibitors did not have specific effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, or cellular orientation. The downstream branches of RTK signaling likely have shared interdependent effects on cellular activities that contribute to morphogenesis.">

        <tr id="Protein kinase C (PKC) plays an essential role during many biological processes including development from early embryonic stages until the terminal differentiation of specialized cells. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the involvement of PKC in molecular processes during the differentiation of stem/precursor cells into tissue cells with a particular focus on osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic and neuronal differentiation by using a comprehensive approach. Interestingly, studies examining the overall role of PKC, or one of its three isoform groups (classical, novel and atypical PKCs), often showed controversial results. A discrete observation of distinct isoforms demonstrated that the impact on differentiation differs highly between the isoforms, and that during a certain process, the influence of only some isoforms is crucial, while others are less important. In particular, PKCβ inhibits, and PKCδ strongly supports osteogenesis, whereas it is the other way around for adipogenesis. PKCε is another isoform that overwhelmingly supports adipogenic differentiation. In addition, PKCα plays an important role in chondrogenesis, while neuronal differentiation has been positively associated with numerous isoforms including classical, novel and atypical PKCs. In a cellular context, various upstream mediators, like the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, endogenously control PKC activity and thus, their activity interferes with the influence of PKC on differentiation. Downstream of PKC, several proteins and pathways build the molecular bridge between the enzyme and the control of differentiation, of which only a few have been well characterized so far. In this context, PKC also cooperates with other kinases like Akt or protein kinase A (PKA). Furthermore, PKC is capable of directly phosphorylating transcription factors with pivotal function for a certain developmental process. Ultimately, profound knowledge about the role of distinct PKC isoforms and the involved signaling pathways during differentiation constitutes a promising tool to improve the use of stem cells in regenerative therapies by precisely manipulating the activity of PKC or downstream effectors.">

        <tr id="Defects in cranial neural tube closure are among the most common and deleterious human structural birth defects. Correct cranial closure requires the coordination of multiple cell dynamic programs including cell proliferation and cell shape change. Mutations that impact Wnt signaling, including loss of the pathway co-receptor LRP6, lead to defects in cranial neural tube closure indicating that this pathway is an important mediator of this critical morphogenetic event, but the cellular dynamics under control of the Wnt pathway during closure remain unclear. Here, we use mice mutant for LRP6 to examine the consequences of conditional and global reduction in Wnt signaling, as well as conditional inactivation of APC to examine the consequences of pathway hyperactivation. Strikingly, we find that regulated Wnt signaling is required for two independent events during cranial neural tube closure. First, global reduction of Wnt leads to a surprising hyperplasia of the cranial neural folds driven by excessive cell proliferation at early pre-elevation stages. The increased tissue volume presents a mechanical blockade to efficient closure despite normal apical constriction and cell polarization at later stages. Conversely, conditional hyperactivation of the pathway at elevation stages prevents apical constriction and neural fold elevation but has no impact on cell polarization or proliferation. Together these data reveal that Wnt signaling levels must be modulated to restrict proliferation at early stages and allow for apical constriction later at elevation stages to promote efficient closure of the cranial neural tube.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment aids cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks, independent of cancer-related mutations. Biophysical properties of this environment, such as the stiffness of the matrix cells adhere to and local cell density, impact proliferation, apoptosis, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The latter is rate-limiting step for invasion and metastasis, enhanced in hypoxic tumor environments but hindered by soft matrices and/or high cell densities. As these influences are often studied in isolation, the crosstalk between hypoxia, biomechanical signals, and the classic EMT driver TGF-β is not well mapped, limiting our ability to predict and anticipate cancer cell behaviors in changing tumor environments. To address this, we built a Boolean regulatory network model that integrates hypoxic signaling with a mechanosensitive model of EMT, which includes the EMT-promoting crosstalk of mitogens and biomechanical signals, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Our model reproduces the requirement of Hif-1α for proliferation, the anti-proliferative effects of strong Hif-1α stabilization during hypoxia, hypoxic protection from anoikis, and hypoxia-driven mechanosensitive EMT. We offer experimentally testable predictions about the effect of VHL loss on cancer hallmarks, with or without secondary oncogene activation. Taken together, our model serves as a predictive framework to synthesize the signaling responses associated with tumor progression and metastasis in healthy vs. mutant cells. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive regulatory network models that cover damage-response and senescence, integrating most cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks into a single model that can, in turn, control the behavior of in silico cells within a tissue model of epithelial homeostasis and carcinoma. Author Summary The cellular environment in and around a tumor can aid cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks. This environment can affect growth and cell death, as well as a phenotype change that renders cells migratory and invasive: the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Hypoxia (low oxygen availability) is known to promote this transition, while the attachment of cells to soft matrices or high cell density environments hinders it. These influences are often studied in isolation. As a result, their crosstalk is poorly understood. To address this, we have built a network model of cellular regulation that integrates a cell’s responses to hypoxia, the biophysical environment, and growth signals to model cell division, death, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in environments cells encounter during metastatic tumor progression. Our model reproduces a wide range of experimental cell responses and offers experimentally testable predictions about the emergence of cancer hallmarks driven mutations that affect the hypoxic response. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive cell-scale models that also include cell aging and damage response. These, in turn, can serve as building blocks of a larger tissue model of healthy vs. cancerous epithelia.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The Hippo signaling governs the expression of genes critically important for cell proliferation and survival. The components of this pathway are considered antitumor drug targets. However, the design of Hippo inhibitors is a challenge given the complexity of the network and redundancy of its elements.


AREAS COVERED
We review the current state-of-the-art in the structure of the Hippo pathway, the microenvironment-induced extracellular cues, the strategies to design pharmacological instruments for inactivation of the Hippo signaling using small molecular weight modulators, as well as the results of initial clinical trials.


EXPERT OPINION
One special characteristic of the Hippo signaling is the adverse role of phosphorylation: opposite to classical kinase cascades that activate the transcription factors, the Hippo kinases retain their partners in a transcriptionally inactive state. Therefore, approaches for pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Hippo protein kinases are counterproductive. The developing alternatives such as disruption of protein-protein interactions or PROTAC techniques are straightforward for preventing the Hippo signaling in cancer therapy.">

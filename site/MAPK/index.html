        <tr id="The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved series of three protein kinases implicated in diverse biological processes. Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.">

        <tr id="Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.">

        <tr id="Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) cascade plays an important role in regulating plant growth and development, generating cellular responses to the extracellular stimuli. MAPKs cascade mainly consist of three sub-families i.e. mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), several cascades of which are activated by various abiotic and biotic stresses. In this work we have modeled the holistic molecular mechanisms essential to MAPKs activation in response to several abiotic and biotic stresses through a system biology approach and performed its simulation studies. As extent of abiotic and biotic stresses goes on increasing, the process of cell division, cell growth and cell differentiation slow down in time dependent manner. The models developed depict the combinatorial and multicomponent signaling triggered in response to several abiotic and biotic factors. These models can be used to predict behavior of cells in event of various stresses depending on their time and exposure through activation of complex signaling cascades.">

        <tr id="Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can operate as bistable switches residing in either of two different stable states. MAPK cascades are often embedded in positive feedback loops, which are considered to be a prerequisite for bistable behavior. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of any imposed feedback regulation, bistability and hysteresis can arise solely from a distributive kinetic mechanism of the two-site MAPK phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Importantly, the reported kinetic properties of the kinase (MEK) and phosphatase (MKP3) of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) fulfill the essential requirements for generating a bistable switch at a single MAPK cascade level. Likewise, a cycle where multisite phosphorylations are performed by different kinases, but dephosphorylation reactions are catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability and hysteresis. Hence, bistability induced by multisite covalent modification may be a widespread mechanism of the control of protein activity.">

        <tr id="Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MC1R) receptors stimulates B‐Raf and C‐Raf isoforms that regulate the dynamics of MAPK1,2 signaling. Network topology motifs in mammalian cells include feed‐for ward and feedback loops and bifans where signals from two upstream molecules integrate to modulate the activity of two downstream molecules. We computation ally modeled and experimentally tested signal processing in the FGFR/MC1R/B‐Raf/C‐Raf/MAPK1,2 net work in human melanoma cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR leads to sustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends critically on the expression level and connectivity to C‐Raf, which is critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Further reducing a 106‐node ordinary differential equations network encompassing the complete network to a 6‐node network encompassing rate‐limiting processes sustains the feedback loops and the bifan, providing sufficient information to predict biological responses.—Muller, M., Obeyesekere, M., Mills, G.

        <tr id="In addition to preventing crosstalk among related signaling pathways, scaffold proteins might facilitate signal transduction by preforming multimolecular complexes that can be rapidly activated by incoming signal. In many cases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, scaffold proteins are necessary for full activation of a signaling pathway. To date, however, no detailed biochemical model of scaffold action has been suggested. Here we describe a quantitative computer model of MAPK cascade with a generic scaffold protein. Analysis of this model reveals that formation of scaffold-kinase complexes can be used effectively to regulate the specificity, efficiency, and amplitude of signal propagation. In particular, for any generic scaffold there exists a concentration value optimal for signal amplitude. The location of the optimum is determined by the concentrations of the kinases rather than their binding constants and in this way is scaffold independent. This effect and the alteration of threshold properties of the signal propagation at high scaffold concentrations might alter local signaling properties at different subcellular compartments. Different scaffold levels and types might then confer specialized properties to tune evolutionarily conserved signaling modules to specific cellular contexts.">

        <tr id="ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors mediate mitogenic signal cascade by binding a variety of ligands and recruiting the different cassettes of adaptor proteins. In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.">

        <tr id="Biochemical interactions at membranes are the starting points for cell signaling networks. But bimolecular reaction kinetics are difficult to experimentally measure on 2-dimensional membranes and are usually measured in volumetric in vitro assays. Membrane tethering produces confinement and steric effects that will significantly impact binding rates in ways that are not readily estimated from volumetric measurements. Also, there are situations when 2D reactions do not conform to simple kinetics. Here we show how highly coarse-grained molecular simulations using the SpringSaLaD software can be used to estimate membrane-tethered rate constants from experimentally determined volumetric kinetics. The approach is validated using an analytical solution for dimerization of binding sites anchored via stiff linkers. This approach can provide 2-dimensional bimolecular rate constants to parameterize cell-scale models of receptor-mediated signaling. We explore how factors such as molecular reach, steric effects, disordered domains, local concentration and diffusion affect the kinetics of binding. We find that for reaction-limited cases, the key determinant in converting 3D to 2D rate constant is the distance of the binding sites from the membrane. On the other hand, the mass action rate law may no longer be obeyed for diffusion-limited reaction on surfaces; the simulations reveal when this situation pertains. We then apply our approach to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediated activation of the membrane-bound small GTPase Ras. The analysis reveals how prior binding of Ras to the allosteric site of SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is recruited to EGFR, significantly accelerates its catalytic activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In cell signaling, the activation of a surface receptor leads to a cascade of intracellular biochemical events. Many of these occur near the inner plasma membrane surface. However, accurate rate parameters for these initial steps in models of signaling are rarely available because membrane-tethered reaction kinetics are difficult to experimentally measure. Here, we use a highly coarse-grained molecular simulator to model the kinetics of reactions between binding sites that are tethered to a membrane. We can fit these simulation outputs to 2-dimensional rate laws to obtain rate constants that can be used to build complex models of cell signaling. These rate constants can also be compared to understand the key biophysical features controlling the kinetics of bimolecular membrane reactions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is a critical regulator of microglial phenotype, including phagocytic function, cytokine expression, and motility, among others. Importantly, both canonical and non-canonical MAPK signaling is directly activated by RTKs, including Interestingly, CSF1R, is activated by two agonists, CSF1 and IL-34, which have been shown to activate the receptor in different ways that can lead to However, little is known about how the affect microglial MAPK signaling, and whether their effects are dependent on disease state/Aβ exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that IL-34 and CSF-1 elicit distinct patterns of MAPK signaling activation in microglia and MAPK activation would be dependent on whether the cells were exposed to Aβ.


METHOD
We applied agonists of CSF1R (i.e., IL-34, CSF1) to the mouse microglial cell (MMC) line, either pre-treated with 500nM of Aβ1-42 or vehicle (1% NH4OH) for 48hr. Cells were serum starved (1hr), stimulated with each agonist for 5min, then lysed for Luminex quantification of a panel of 10 MAPK phosphoproteins.


RESULT
In the absence of Aβ1-42, both CSF1R and IL-34 stimulated both canonical (ERK) and non-canonical (p38, JNK) MAPK signaling phospho-proteins (Wilcox test, p<0.05 vs control). While Aβ1-42 pre-treatment resulted in diminished activation in canonical MAPK signaling (i.e., MEK, ERK) following either CSF1 or IL-34 stimulation, CSF1 stimulation of non-canonical MAPK signaling through p38 and JNK was preserved with Aβ1-42 pre-treatment. These findings indicate that CSF1-induced signaling is robust regardless of Aβ1-42 exposure. Furthermore, different agonists of the same receptor distinctly activate non-canonical MAPK pathway signaling (p38). Collectively, this finding supports the overall hypothesis that CSF-1R-induced signaling is dependent on Aβ and Aβ pre-treatments shift the canonical ERK signaling to non-canonical p38 signaling.


CONCLUSION
These findings show that different agonists of CSF1R can provoke distinct profiles of canonical and non-canonical MAPK pathway signaling in the presence of Aβ1-42. Understanding differences in agonist-specific microglial signaling in healthy and diseased microglia will be essential to designing microglial-targeted therapeutics for treatment of AD.">

        <tr id="Cell states evolve through the combined activity of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. While transcription factors can direct cell fate, these factors rely on a cell state that is receptive to transitions in cell identity. How signaling levels contribute to the emergence of receptive cell states remains poorly defined in primary cells. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, we examined how levels of the MAPK-activating oncogene HRASG12V influence direct conversion of primary fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. We demonstrate that an optimal ‘Goldilocks’ level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Rates of direct conversion respond biphasically to increasing HRASG12V levels. While intermediate HRASG12V levels increase the rate of conversion, high levels of HRASG12V induce senescence. Through chemogenetic tuning, we set optimal MAPK activity for high rates of conversion in the absence of HRAS mutants. As MAPK pathways influence cell-fate transitions in development and disease, our results highlight the need to tune therapeutic interventions within a non-monotonic landscape that is shaped by genetics and levels of gene expression.

        <tr id="Reversible protein phosphorylation directs essential cellular processes including cell division, cell growth, cell death, inflammation, and differentiation. Because protein phosphorylation drives diverse diseases, kinases and phosphatases have been targets for drug discovery, with some achieving remarkable clinical success. Most protein kinases are activated by phosphorylation of their activation loops, which shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase toward the active state. To turn off the kinase, protein phosphatases dephosphorylate these sites, but how the conformation of the dynamic activation loop contributes to dephosphorylation was not known. To answer this, we modulated the activation loop conformational equilibrium of human p38α ΜΑP kinase with existing kinase inhibitors that bind and stabilize specific inactive activation loop conformations. From this, we identified three inhibitors that increase the rate of dephosphorylation of the activation loop phospho-threonine by the PPM serine/threonine phosphatase WIP1. Hence, these compounds are "dual-action" inhibitors that simultaneously block the active site and promote p38α dephosphorylation. Our X-ray crystal structures of phosphorylated p38α bound to the dual-action inhibitors reveal a shared flipped conformation of the activation loop with a fully accessible phospho-threonine. In contrast, our X-ray crystal structure of phosphorylated apo human p38α reveals a different activation loop conformation with an inaccessible phospho-threonine, thereby explaining the increased rate of dephosphorylation upon inhibitor binding. These findings reveal a conformational preference of phosphatases for their targets and suggest a unique approach to achieving improved potency and specificity for therapeutic kinase inhibitors.">

MKP-5 dephosphorylates the stress-responsive MAPKs, p38 MAPK and JNK, and has been shown to promote tissue fibrosis. Here, we provide insight into how MKP-5 regulates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway, a well-established driver of fibrosis. We show that MKP-5-deficient fibroblasts in response to TGF-β are impaired in SMAD2 phosphorylation at canonical and non-canonical sites, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation of fibrogenic genes. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of MKP-5 is sufficient to block TGF-β signaling, and that this regulation occurs through a JNK-dependent pathway. By utilizing RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis, we identify TGF-β signaling activators regulated by MKP-5 in a JNK-dependent manner, providing mechanistic insight into how MKP-5 promotes TGF-β signaling. This study elucidates a novel mechanism whereby MKP-5-mediated JNK inactivation is required for TGF-β signaling and provides insight into the role of MKP-5 in tissue fibrosis.">

 Alterations in the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade are common across multiple solid tumor types and is a driver for many cancers. NST-628 is a potent pan-RAF-MEK molecular glue that prevents phosphorylation and activation of MEK by RAF, overcoming the limitations of traditional RAS-MAPK inhibitors and leading to deep durable inhibition of the pathway. Cellular, biochemical, and structural analysis of RAF-MEK complexes show that NST-628 engages all isoforms of RAF, including ARAF, and prevents the formation of BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, a differentiated mechanism from all current RAF inhibitors. With a potent and durable inhibition of the RAF-MEK signaling complex as well as high intrinsic permeability into the brain, NST-628 demonstrates broad efficacy in cellular and patient-derived tumor models harboring diverse MAPK pathway alterations, including orthotopic intracranial models. Given a mechanism differentiated from previous therapies targeting RAF or MEK catalytic activity, NST-628 is positioned to make an impact clinically in an areas of unmet patient need.

        <tr id="Eukaryotic cells chemosense concentration gradients of extracellular ligands using membrane-bound receptors that polarize their activity. Receptors from several chemosensing families are preferentially degraded after activation and undergo significant lateral diffusion, both of which may blunt their polarization. To explore the combined role of these two seemingly detrimental phenomena on active receptor polarization, we use a reaction/diffusion model. The model elucidates a counterintuitive principle that governs receptor polarization under external gradients: Localized Activity and Global Sensitization (LAGS). In LAGS, receptor activity is localized through receptor degradation or ligand unbinding. In contrast, uniform sensitivity to ligands is maintained over the plasma membrane through lateral receptor diffusion. Surprisingly, increasing preferential degradation of active receptors and increasing lateral diffusion of all receptors both sharpen active receptor polarization. Additionally, when combined with receptor oligomerization, an increase in preferential degradation allows cells to sense relative ligand gradients over a larger range of background ligand concentrations. An analytical model identifies parameter regimes that dictate which processes dominate receptor polarization. A survey of kinetic parameters suggests that receptor polarization in many mammalian pathways can be modeled using LAGS.">

        <tr id="Signaling pathways enable cells to coordinate collective behaviors by exchanging specific information. Many pathways utilize multiple ligand variants to activate the same intracellular signaling cascade, raising the question of how cells discriminate between these seemingly redundant signals. It has been shown that individual cells can discriminate between signals based on their induced level of activity, temporal dynamics or combinatorial effect. Here, we demonstrate that ligand discrimination could also emerge at the population level. Using mathematical models of ligand-receptor interactions, we examine how response heterogeneity at the population level can encode ligand identity. We introduce a local scaling metric to quantify how variation in pathway components affects the cellular response. Our results reveal that for pathways with dimeric receptors, and more significantly for heterodimeric receptors, biochemical parameters of the ligands control the resulting heterogeneity in the response of a population of cells. Furthermore, we show that the population-level heterogeneity encodes the enzymatic activity of the resulting receptor complex. This suggests a functional advantage for utilizing heterodimeric receptor complexes in pathways acting across a population of cells, such as the type I interferon pathway, which shows several of the characteristics of our model. This contrasts to juxtacrine pathways, such as Notch, that do not act at the population level and use a single component receptor. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which receptor architecture enables cells to encode ligand-specific information through population-level heterogeneity, offering insights into immune regulation, tissue development, and synthetic biology. Significance Statement Cells often communicate using distinct molecular signals (ligands) that activate the same pathway. Yet, how cells distinguish between these signals remains unclear. This study reveals that ligand discrimination can emerge at the level of entire cell populations, not just individual cells. By analyzing mathematical models, we show that certain receptor architectures, especially those involving heterodimeric receptors, allow signals to control the heterogeneity of the response level across a population. This mechanism enables cell populations to decode specific information about their environment, impacting processes like immune responses and tissue development. Our findings provide new insights into how signals coordinate collective behaviors and suggest strategies for designing synthetic systems to precisely control biological responses.">

        <tr id="A lack of tools for detecting receptor activity in vivo has limited our ability to fully explore receptor-level control of developmental patterning. Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.">

        <tr id="Understanding how cells migrate following exogenous cues is one of the most fundamental questions for biology, medicine, and bioengineering. Growing evidence shows that electrotaxis, the directed cell migration toward electric potential gradients, represents a precise and programmable method to control cell migration. Most data suggest that the polarization of membrane components and the following downstream signaling are central to electrotaxis. Unfortunately, how these multiple mechanisms coordinate with the motile machinery of the cell to respond to an electric field is still poorly understood. Here, we develop a mechanistic model that explains and recapitulate electrotaxis across different cell types. Using the zebrafish proteome, we identify membrane proteins directly related to migration signaling pathways that polarize anodally and cathodally. Further, we show that simultaneous and asymmetric distribution of charged membrane receptors towards the anode and the cathode establishes multiple cooperative and competing stimuli for downstream signaling pathways. The resulting polarization of signals controls the actomyosin network dynamics, directing the anodal and cathodal migration of the cell. Our theoretical framework rationalizes the physical processes that determine electrotaxis across cell types and provides a physical framework to test multiple electrotactic pathways. These results together show us how to control cell migration to, e.g., enhance, cancel, or switch directed cell migration, which opens up new avenues not only to promote tissue regeneration or arrest tumor progression but also to design better biomimetic-engineered tissue constructs.">

Genetically encoded fluorescent probes are instrumental in dissecting the ERK activity dynamics in living cells. Here we modified a previously reported Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe for ERK, EKAREN5 by replacing its mTurquoise2 and YPet sequences with mTurquoise-GL and a synonymous codon variant of YPet, respectively. The modified biosensor, EKAREN5-gl showed an increased sensitivity to EGF-induced ERK activation responding to a very low dose (20 pg/ml) of EGF stimulation. We quantitatively characterized two FRET-based ERK probes, EKAREN5 and EKAREN5-gl, and a subcellular kinase translocation-based probe, ERK-KTR. We found the three biosensors differently respond to EGF stimulations with different intensity, duration, and latency. Furthermore, we investigated how the minimal EGF-induced ERK activation affects the downstream transcription in HeLa cells by comprehensive transcriptional analysis. We found the minimal ERK activation leads to a distinct transcriptional pattern from those induced by higher ERK activations. Our study highlights the significance of sensitive fluorescent probes to understand cellular signal dynamics and the role of minimal ERK activation in regulating transcription.Key words: fluorescent probe, ERK, FRET, KTR.">

We achieved this by augmenting the multiscale PLP workflow we call MultiMap, where three photo-probes with different labeling ranges were photo-activated by one photocatalyst, Eosin Y. By anchoring Eosin Y extracellularly and intracellularly on EGFR, we captured hundreds of proteins on both sides of the cell membrane that change in proximity to EGFR upon EGF activation. Neighbors engaged with EGFR within minutes to over an hour, reflecting dynamic interactomes during early, mid- and late-signaling including phosphorylation, internalization, degradation and transcriptional regulation.

        <tr id="Cells compartmentalize biochemical processes using physical barriers in the form of membranes. Eukaryotes have a wide diversity of membrane-based compartments that can be used in this context, with the main ones being the extracellular membrane, which separates the inside from the outside of the cell, and the nuclear membrane, which separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear membrane not only isolates and protects the DNA and the transcription and replication processes from the other processes that are occurring in the cytoplasm but also has an active role in the regulation of cellular signaling. The TGF-β pathway is one of the most important and conserved signaling cascades, and it achieves compartmentalization using a well-tuned balance between the import and export rates of the active and inactive forms of key proteins. Thus, compartmentalization serves as an additional regulatory mechanism, physically isolating transcription factors from their targets, influencing the dynamics and strength of signal transduction. This contribution focuses on this biophysical layer of regulation, using the TGF-β pathway to illustrate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, as well as the biological consequences of this compartmentalization. We also introduce a simplified mathematical formulation for studying the dynamics of this process using a generalized approach.">

        <tr id="Signaling by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is regulated by temporally distinct processes including receptor desensitization, internalization, and lysosomal sorting, and are tightly controlled by post-translational modifications. While the role of phosphorylation in regulating GPCR signaling is well studied and established, the mechanisms by which other post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, regulate GPCR signaling are not clearly defined. We hypothesize that GPCR ubiquitination and deubiquitination is critical for proper signaling and cellular responses. In the present study, we show that the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease-34 (USP34) regulates thrombin-stimulated protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1)-induced p38 autophosphorylation and activation. The PAR1-stimulated p38 signaling pathway is driven by ubiquitination. Interestingly, small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of USP34 expression markedly increased PAR1 cell surface abundance and protein expression without modulating PAR1 ubiquitination or the ubiquitination status of p38 signaling pathway components. In addition, increased PAR1 expression observed in USP34-depleted cells was not caused by altered PAR1 constitutive internalization, agonist-induced internalization, or receptor degradation. Rather, we report that loss of USP34 expression increased mRNA transcript expression of the PAR1-encoding gene, F2R. This study unexpectedly identified a critical role for USP34 in regulation of F2R mRNA transcript expression, which modulates PAR1 cell surface levels and thrombin-stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.">

        <tr id="Cell fate decisions are regulated by intricate signaling networks, with Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) being a central regulator. However, ERK is rarely the only signaling pathway involved, creating a need to study multiple signaling pathways simultaneously at the single-cell level. Many existing fluorescent biosensors for ERK and other pathways have significant spectral overlap, limiting their ability to be multiplexed. To address this limitation, we developed two novel red-FRET ERK biosensors, REKAR67 and REKAR76, which operate in the 670-720 nm range using miRFP670nano3 and miRFP720. REKAR67 and REKAR76 differ in fluorophore position, which impacts biosensor characteristics; REKAR67 displayed a higher dynamic range but greater signal variance than REKAR76. Mixed populations of REKAR67 or REKAR76 displayed similar Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), but in clonal cell populations, REKAR76 had a significantly higher SNR. Overall, our red-FRET ERK biosensors were highly consistent with existing ERK FRET biosensors and in reporting ERK activity and are spectrally compatible with CFP/YFP FRET and cpGFP -based biosensors. Both REKAR biosensors expand the available methods for measuring single-cell ERK activity.">

        <tr id="The p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes. Phosphorylation serves as a canonical way to regulate p38α activation through a phosphorylation cascade. Thus, understanding the mechanism governing p38α phosphorylation is important. The present study demonstrated that p38α undergoes methylation at K165, which promote its phosphorylation in tumor cells. Inhibition of p38α methylation impairs p38α phosphorylation, repressing tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, KDM5D is a demethylase that interacts with p38α, mediating demethylation at K165 and inhibiting p38α phosphorylation. Moreover, KDM5D is expressed at low levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and high KDM5D expression is positively correlated with cancer survival. KDM5D markedly inhibits cell proliferation and migration via inactivating p38α, thereby slowing cancer progression in xenograft models. In summary, these findings highlight KDM5D as a demethylase of p38α at K165, elucidating a unique role for lysine demethylation in integrating cytoplasmic kinase-signaling cascades. The present results revealed the critical role of KDM5D in suppressing tumor progression, suggesting that KDM5D can serve as a potential drug target for combating hyperactive p38α-driven lung cancer.">

In granulosa cells (GCs), these pathways are activated by FSH and IGF1 through respective receptors. We investigated the comparative transcriptome changes induced by AKT and ERK pathways using corresponding inhibitors in GCs. GCs isolated from antral follicles showed positive signals for phospho-AKT and -ERK proteins. Treatment of cultured GCs with FSH and IGF1 induced phospho-AKT and -ERK levels. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1436 genes regulated by AKT and 654 genes regulated by ERK pathway. Among these, 94 genes were commonly downregulated, and 11 genes were commonly upregulated in both data sets, while 110 genes were oppositely regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inhibition of PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways downregulates key reproductive processes and upstream molecules. Notably, AKT inhibition affected FSH, ESRRG, and HIF1 pathways, while ERK inhibition impacted CG, FOS, TGFβ, EGR1, and LH pathways. Transcriptome data showed that genes related to estradiol production were inhibited by ERK and induced by the AKT pathway. This was verified by radioimmunoassays, and mRNA and protein analysis of CYP19A1 and STAR genes. In addition, transcriptome data suggested downregulation of glucose metabolism in GCs. Using validation experiments, we confirm that both pathways are essential for glucose uptake, lactate production, and mitochondrial activity in GCs. These data provide a resource for informing future research for analyzing various novel candidate genes regulated by AKT and ERK pathways in GCs and other cell types.">

        <tr id="Animal bodies are equipped to sense injuries and respond, and rapid activation of ERK signaling at wound sites has emerged as a recurring mechanism across metazoans. During whole-body regeneration, distant species including cnidarians, planarians and echinoderms activate ERK at wounds to drive early transcriptional changes. However, it is unclear to what extent these are distinct phenomena, utilizing a common effector pathway but with different upstream inputs and downstream functions, or are more deeply alike, sharing upstream inputs, activating cell type(s), or spatiotemporal dynamics. To facilitate thorough comparisons across animals, we examined wound-induced ERK during whole-body regeneration in the acoel Hofstenia miamia. ERK signaling is induced at wound sites within 10 minutes post-amputation and peaks in activity within one hour. ERK is required for head and tail regeneration and inhibiting ERK suppresses the expression of wound-induced genes, which are themselves required for regeneration. Quantification of spatial dynamics revealed that active ERK spreads rapidly away from the wound site during the first 30 minutes post-amputation and continues to expand in space through 3-6 hours, albeit at lower levels. Multiple cell types activate ERK including neoblasts (stem cells) and muscle, and ERK is spatially dynamic within both cell types, however, ERK activation in muscle does not require neoblasts. Finally, neuregulin-1, a putative ligand produced exclusively by muscle cells, is required for ERK activation at wounds. Altogether, our data identify a key signaling role of muscle cells in driving ERK activation in multiple cell types after injury, and describe a spatial spreading phenomenon with parallels to dynamic ERK patterns in other systems.">

During tumorigenesis, these pathways become deregulated, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, enhanced migratory and metastatic capabilities, evasion of programmed cell death, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The RAS and MYC oncogenes are pivotal in tumorigenesis, driving processes such as resistance to apoptosis, replicative immortality, cellular invasion and metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming. These oncogenes are subject to regulation by a range of epigenetic and post-transcriptional modifications. This review focuses on the deregulation of EGFR, RAS, and MYC expression caused by (epi)genetic alterations and post-translational modifications. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting these regulatory proteins, emphasizing the importance of phenotyping neoplastic tissues to inform the treatment of cancer.">

Kinases and phosphatases are generally highly conserved across eukaryotes, underlining their importance for post-translational regulation of substrate proteins. In recent years, advances in phospho-proteomics have shed light on protein phosphorylation dynamics throughout the cell cycle, and ongoing progress in bioinformatics has significantly improved annotation of specific phosphorylation events to a given kinase. However, the functional impact of individual phosphorylation events on cell cycle progression is often unclear. To address this question, we used the Synthetic Physical Interactions (SPI) method, which enables the systematic recruitment of phospho-regulators to most yeast proteins. Using this method, we identified several putative novel targets involved in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The SPI method monitors cell growth and, therefore, serves as a tool to determine the impact of protein phosphorylation on cell cycle progression.">

        <tr id="Signalling molecules often contribute to several signalling pathways that produce distinct transcriptional outputs and cellular phenotypes. One of the major unanswered questions in cell biology is how multiple activities of signalling molecules are coordinated in space and time in vivo. Here, we focus on the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) protein as a paradigm of signalling molecules involved in several independent signalling pathways. In addition to the canonical pathways, whereby STAT is phosphorylated and activated by Janus Kinases, STAT is involved in at least two non-canonical pathways. In one pathway, STAT is activated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) promoting apoptosis. In another, it binds the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) to enhance heterochromatin formation. Using Drosophila wing discs as an epithelial system, we demonstrate that all three STAT activities coexist in this tissue. We provide evidence that while the canonical STAT signalling is dominant over non-canonical pathways, EGFR:STAT and HP1:STAT pathways compete for the availability of unphosphorylated STAT. We also describe the role of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin in EGFR:STAT signalling. Both EGFR and STAT colocalise with E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions and on intracellular vesicles. Elevated intracellular E-cadherin promotes EGFR:STAT pathway leading to apoptosis, whereas blocking E-cadherin endocytosis prevents apoptosis induction. Altogether, we propose that E-cadherin endocytosis controls the balance between two non-canonical STAT activities in a potential tumour-suppressive mechanism – junctional disassembly in dysregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions would shift this balance towards the EGFR:STAT signalling to promote apoptosis.">

The main goal of this study was to explore whether Ang III induces ERK1/2 MAPK and VSMC proliferation in cultured Wistar VSMCs. Further, the Ang III actions were compared to those observed in VSMCs derived from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). We hypothesized that in VSMCs Ang III will have similar actions as Ang II to induce ERK1/2 MAPK and cellular proliferation and this ability may be different in VSMCs isolated from Wistar versus SHR rats. Time and/or concentration-dependent effects of Ang III and Ang II were determined in VSMCs using western blot analysis and DNA incorporation assay. The results showed that ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation mediated by Ang II or Ang III were concentration- and time-dependent in Wistar VSMCs. Moreover, Ang III was less effective in mediating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in SHR VSMCs as compared to effects seen in Wistar rat VSMCs. Ang III induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation through the AT1 receptors activation. Ang II and Ang III induced VSMC DNA synthesis via the AT1 receptor in a concentration-dependent manner in Wistar VSMCs. Moreover, Ang III induced VSMC proliferation and significant differences existed in the peptide's proliferation effects in Wistar versus SHR VSMCs. These results indicate that Ang III stimulates ERK1/2 MAPK and DNA synthesis in VSMCs via AT1 receptors. However, its ability to stimulate these pathways is reduced in SHR VSMCs.">

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition with erlotinib also induces AQP2 membrane trafficking with a phosphorylation pattern similar to VP, but without increasing PKA activity. Here, we identify the ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) as a major mediator phosphorylating AQP2 in this novel, erlotinib-induced pathway. We found that RSK was expressed in collecting duct principal cells in rat kidneys. RSK inhibition with BI-D1870 blocked erlotinib-induced AQP2 serine 256 (S256) phosphorylation and membrane accumulation. CRISPR-generated RSK knockout cells failed to show increased S256 phosphorylation in response to erlotinib. Like PKA, RSK was able to phosphorylate AQP2 S256 in vitro. Inhibition of PDK1, a known activator of RSK, blocked erlotinib-induced AQP2 S256 phosphorylation and membrane accumulation. We conclude that RSK is a crucial terminal kinase phosphorylating AQP2 at S256 upon EGFR inhibition by erlotinib.">

Depending on the specific interaction pattern with the receptor, βarrs adopt multiple conformational states, each tightly linked to a specific functional outcome of βarr recruitment. Despite its physiological relevance, the structural determinants of βarr activation remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical and cell-based experiments, we reveal how specific interactions with a prototypical GPCR promote the unbinding of the βarr2 C-tail—a crucial step in arrestin activation. Importantly, we observe that the expulsion of the C-tail is promoted by the displacement of a conserved arginine residue (Arg394) within the βarr polar core, which we dub “the arginine switch.” Our study uncovers a previously unknown molecular switch that, upon engagement, destabilizes the polar core as a crucial step in the GPCR-induced βarr activation.">

This targeting requires scaffolding proteins to bring Erk1/2 and their substrates together. In the case of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced signaling that activates Erk1/2 to phosphorylate Pak1 for cell migration, Erk1/2 remain at the plasma membrane. Thus, it has been unclear in this case whether a scaffolding protein is needed for substrate targeting by Erk1/2. The small GTPase Arf-like protein (Arl) 4D also promotes cell migration by targeting Pak1 to the plasma membrane. However, as this recruitment also results in the phosphorylation of Pak1, it has been unclear how this phosphorylation is achieved. Furthermore, because both Erk1/2 and Arl4D promote the role of Pak1 in cell migration, the relationship between these two processes has also been unclear. Addressing these outstanding questions, we show that Arl4D acts as a scaffolding protein by recruiting Erk1/2 and Pak1 to the plasma membrane for their assembly into a protein complex. Our findings identify Arl4D as a novel regulator of Erk1/2, reveal a conserved role for scaffolding proteins in substrate targeting by Erk1/2, as well as uncovering a previously unknown interplay among Arl4D, Erk1/2, and Pak1. Moreover, as all these factors are known to be involved in cell migration, we have shed new mechanistic insights into how this fundamental cellular process occurs.">

Then, we discuss how nanodomains act as organizing centers by mediating protein-protein interactions that orchestrate essential processes such as symbiosis, defense against pathogens, ion transport or hormonal and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Finally, we introduce the concept of nanoenvironments, where localized physicochemical variations are generated in the very close proximity of PM nanodomains, in response to stimuli. After decoding by a dedicated machinery likely localized in the vicinity of nanodomains, this enrichment of secondary messengers, such as ROS or Ca2+, would allow specific downstream cellular responses. This review provides insights into the dynamic nature of nanodomains and proposes future research to better understand their contribution to the intricate signaling networks that govern plant development and stress responses.">

Using super resolution STORM microscopy, we characterize the changes in the actin cytoskeleton, on the single filament level, that arise from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ARHGAP18. We report that the loss of ARHGAP18 results in alterations of the cell that derive from both aberrant RhoA signaling and inappropriate nuclear localization of YAP. These findings indicate that the Hippo and Rho family GTPase signaling cascades are coordinated in their temporal and spatial control of the actin cytoskeleton.">

        <tr id="Morphogen gradients convey essential spatial information during tissue patterning. While both concentration and timing of morphogen exposure are crucial, how cells interpret these graded inputs remains challenging to address. We employed an optogenetic system to acutely and reversibly modulate the nuclear concentration of the morphogen Dorsal (DL), homologue of NF-κB, which orchestrates dorso-ventral patterning in the Drosophila embryo. By controlling DL nuclear concentration while simultaneously recording target gene outputs in real time, we identified a critical window for DL action that is required to instruct patterning, and characterized the resulting effect on spatio-temporal transcription of target genes in terms of timing, coordination, and bursting. We found that a transient decrease in nuclear DL levels at nuclear cycle 13 leads to reduced expression of the mesoderm-associated gene snail (sna) and partial derepression of the neurogenic ectoderm-associated target short gastrulation (sog) in ventral regions. Surprisingly, the mispatterning elicited by this transient change in DL is detectable at the level of single cell transcriptional bursting kinetics, specifically affecting long inter-burst durations. Our approach of using temporally-resolved and reversible modulation of a morphogen in vivo, combined with mathematical modeling, establishes a framework for understanding the stimulus-response relationships that govern embryonic patterning.">

        <tr id="T cell receptor signaling must operate reliably under tight time constraints. While assuming quite different mechanisms, two prominent models of T cell receptor activation, kinetic segregation and kinetic proofreading, both introduce a distinct time scale. However, a clear understanding of whether and how those characteristic times give rise to a consistent timing of T cell receptor activation in the presence of stochastic fluctuations has been lacking so far. Here, using a simulation approach capable of modeling molecular interactions between adjacent cell membranes, we explore a stochastic model that combines elements of kinetic segregation and proofreading. Our simulations suggest that the two mechanisms interoperate, thereby rendering the corresponding stochastic times biologically functional. Receptor activation relies on rare molecular events that are not well characterized by the mean of the underlying probability density function. Yet, a consistent timing of receptor activation can be ensured by a modest number of proofreading steps.">

Although it functions in a variety of processes, the net output of JAK-STAT signalling depends on its spatiotemporal activation, as well as extensive crosstalk with other signalling pathways. Drosophila, with its relatively simple signal transduction pathways and plethora of genetic analysis tools, is an ideal system for dissecting JAK-STAT signalling interactions. In this review, we explore studies in Drosophila revealing that JAK-STAT signalling lies at the nexus of a complex network of interlinked pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Notch, Insulin, Hippo, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Hedgehog (Hh) and Wingless (Wg). These pathways can synergise with or antagonise one another to produce a variety of outcomes. Given the conserved nature of signal transduction pathways, we conclude with our perspective on the implication of JAK-STAT signalling dysregulation in human diseases, and how studies in Drosophila have the potential to inform and influence clinical research.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis. The natural compound pristimerin has shown promising anti-tumor effect. Here, it is found that pristimerin significantly triggered the activation of autophagy initiation and induced apoptosis in TNBC. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing revealed that pristimerin activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracelluar regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Drug affinity responsive target stability and mass spectrometry techniques are employed to confirm the direct binding target of pristimerin. Heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8) is identified and verified by cellular thermal shift assays and surface plasmon resonance assays. The further results suggested that pristimerin promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA8, leading to a decrease in the degradation of Vac Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 (VAV1), a downstream client protein of HSPA8 which plays a crucial role in activating the ERK pathway. Importantly, knockdown of HSPA8 or VAV1 significantly impaired the anticancer activity of pristimerin on TNBC cells. Additionally, pristimerin significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of TNBC cells and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to doxorubicin. Collectively, this study provides the initial evidence that pristimerin directly targets HSPA8 to activate the VAV1/ERK pathway, thereby promoting cell autophagy and apoptosis.">

        <tr id="The heart adapts to cardiac demand through a variety of mechanisms. Some of these adaptations include chemical modifications of myofilament proteins responsible for cell contraction. Interestingly, many of these chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, are found in unstructured, or intrinsically disordered, regions of proteins. For these myofilament assoiciated proteins with intrinsic disorder (MAPIDs), it has been difficult to determine how their disordered regions influence the function of the intact protein or the myofilament as a whole. Given that cardiac dysfunction can be accompanied by dramatic shifts in post-translational modifications (PTMs) of myofilament proteins, assessment of these impacts in intrinsically disordered regions is important. We hypothesized that regulation of the actin-binding myofilament protein LIM protein 1, ABLIM1, through its IDRs occurs because PTMs, namely phosphorylation, alter their conformation ensembles. The change in conformations thereby toggles their availability for binding protein partners. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used molecular dynamics to simulate ABLIM1 and thereby determine its conformation ensemble before and after phosphorylation. In accordance with published phosphorylation data in GSK3β knockout models, our results indicate that local changes in the physicochemical properties of ABLIM1’s IDRs via phosphorylation can influence its global ensemble properties, with the potential to impact its interaction with myofilament targets like titin. These findings provide important molecular-level insights into a mechanism of regulating cardiomyocyte contraction.">

        <tr id="The EphA2 transmembrane receptor is a key regulator of cellular growth, differentiation, and motility, and its overexpression in various cancers positions it as a promising biomarker for clinical cancer management. EphA2 signaling is mediated through ligand-induced dimerization, which stabilizes its dimeric state via conformational changes in the extracellular region and is linked to the intracellular kinase region via the transmembrane (TM) domain. Similar to many receptor tyrosine kinases, the juxtamembrane (JM) region, located between the TM and catalytic domains, coordinates with the TM domain to facilitate signal transduction. Electrostatic interactions between basic residues of the JM region and signaling lipids, such as PIP2 and PIP3, play a critical role by sequestration thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of the JM and other intracellular tyrosines. Cholesterol’s potential role in allosterically modulating EphA2 activation has remained unclear. Therefore, elucidating the structural mechanism of EphA2 dimerization and its membrane interactions is essential for understanding the influence of these lipids. In this study, we modeled the TM-full JM peptide of the EphA2 receptor and employed both coarse-grain (CG) and all-atom (AA) simulations to investigate the conformational transitions of the EphA2 transmembrane region dimer in cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-deficient membranes. Our study reveals that cholesterol stabilizes specific EphA2 TM dimers and TM-JM PIP2 interactions, highlighting the critical role of membrane composition in regulating EphA2 dimerization, oligomerization, and clustering.">

Subsequent interaction between SUMO and SUMO-interacting motif drives Fu/Ulk3 self-assembly to form biomolecular condensates that recruit Ci-Sufu and Gli-Sufu in the cytoplasm and primary cilium, respectively. Within the condensates, Fu/Ulk3 undergoes a conformational change to expose Ci/Gli for Fu/Ulk3-mediated phosphorylation and activation, leading to gradual accumulation of nuclear CiA/GliA transcriptional complexes in proportion to ligand dose and exposure time. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal control of Hh signal transduction, reveal previously unexplored regulatory mechanism and function for biomolecular condensation, and establish a paradigm for kinase-mediated signal transduction whereby a kinase allosterically activates its substrate through ligand-induced and condensation-driven conformational change.">

LY294002 inhibitor was used to study the role of PI3K in the ATP-dependent regulation of skeletal muscle signaling during three days of unloading. Inhibition of PI3K during soleus muscle unloading slows down the atrophic processes and prevents the accumulation of ATP and the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 and ubiquitin. It also prevents the increase in the expression of IP3 receptors and regulates the activity of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways by reducing the mRNA expression of the Ca2+-dependent marker calcineurin (CaN) and decreasing the phosphorylation of CaMKII. It also affects the regulation of markers of anabolic signaling in unloaded muscles: IRS1 and 4E-BP. PI3K is an important mediator of skeletal muscle atrophy during unloading.

Here, we present the discovery and characterization of novel small-molecule allosteric inhibitors of βarrs through comprehensive biophysical, biochemical, pharmacological, and structural analyses. These inhibitors disrupt βarr interactions with agonist-activated GPCRs, impairing receptor internalization, desensitization, and βarr-mediated physiological functions. A cryo-EM structure of βarr1 in complex with the allosteric inhibitor Cmpd-5, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies, reveals that Cmpd-5 binds within a cryptic cleft formed by the middle, C-, and lariat loops–a critical site for βarr activation and recruitment to GPCRs. Thus, Cmpd-5 acts as a molecular lock, hindering βarr1 activation via an allosteric mechanism. These findings introduce novel strategies and tools for probing βarr functions.

Besides genotoxicity, BPDE has more recently been reported to alter the NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt, that are involved in inflammation, cell survival and cell proliferation. From the above molecular docking analysis of BPDE binding to the potential proteins of these pathways, the mechanism of action of the compound is examined. The studies conducted on docking reveal moderate binding affinity of BPDE with NF-κB, that is, -6.11 kcal/mol, which points out its role in inflammation and oncogenic signaling. In addition, BPDE has more protein-binding affinities within the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway for CDK1 (-7.46 kcal/mol), LOX (-7.47 kcal/mol), and CDK6 (-6.84 kcal/mol). These indicate that influence of BPDE in tumour progression should not be only through the activation of NF-κB but would rather be supported by significant inputs of pathways that include PI3K/Akt and MAPK. This interaction would seem to favor cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis resistance. Broader analysis of the data presented allows defining NF-κB as one of the key molecules contributing to BPDE-induced carcinogenesis; however, the data also point to the significant participation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in this process. Future work should also more fully detail how these pathways interconnect and also evaluate the effectiveness of inhibiting NF-κB and related pathways in preventing BPDE’s carcinogenic action.

        <tr id="The BCR::ABL1 oncogene plays a crucial role in the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previous studies have investigated the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics in various cancers, revealing potential therapeutic strategies. However, the impact of BCR::ABL1 on mitochondrial dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that BCR::ABL1 is sufficient to induce excessive mitochondrial fragmentation by activating dynamin-related protein (DRP)1 through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Leukocytes obtained from patients with CML and the BCR::ABL1-positive cell lines exhibited increased mitochondrial fragmentation compared to leukocytes obtained from healthy donors and BCR::ABL1-negative cells. Furthermore, the analysis of BCR::ABL1-transduced cells showed increased phosphorylation of DRP1 at serine 616 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Moreover, the inhibition of DRP1 and upstream mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) 1/2 suppressed mitochondrial fragmentation. Strikingly, DRP1 inhibition effectively reduced the viability of BCR::ABL1-positive cells and induced necrotic cell death. Additionally, a label-free artificial intelligence-driven flow cytometry successfully identified not only the BCR::ABL1-transduced cells but also peripheral leukocytes from CML patients by assessing mitochondrial morphological alterations.

        <tr id="Preclinical testing and validation of therapeutic strategies developed for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) require a cohort of virtual patients (VPs). However, current simulators provide a limited number of VPs, lack real-life scenarios, and inadequately represent intra- and inter-day variability in insulin sensitivity and blood glucose (BG) profile. The generation of a realistic scenario was achieved by using the meal patterns, insulin profiles (basal and bolus), and exercise sessions estimated as disturbances using clinical data from a cohort of 14 T1D patients using the Medtronic 640G insulin pump provided by the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona. The UVa/Padova’s cohort of adult patients was used for the generation of a new cohort of VPs. Insulin model parameters were optimized and adjusted in a day-by-day fashion to replicate the clinical data to create a cohort of 75 VPs. All primary and secondary outcomes reflecting the BG profile of a T1D patient were analyzed and compared to the clinical data. The mean BG 166.3 versus 162.2 mg/dL ( = 0.19), coefficient of variation 32% versus 33% ( = 0.54), and percent of time in range (70 to 180 mg/dL) 59.6% versus 66.8% ( = 0.35) were achieved. The proposed methodology for generating a cohort of VPs is capable of mimicking the BG metrics of a real cohort of T1D patients from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona. It can adopt the inter-day variations in the BG profile, similar to the observed clinical data, and thus provide a benchmark for preclinical testing of control techniques and therapy strategies for T1D patients.">

        <tr id="Objectives: The goal of this study was to develop a system model of type 1 diabetes for the purpose of in silico simulation for the prediction of long-term glycemic control outcomes. Methods: The system model was created and identified on a physiological cohort of virtual type 1 diabetes patients (n = 40). Integral-based identification was used to develop (n = 40) insulin sensitivity profiles. Results: The n = 40 insulin sensitivity profiles provide a driving input for virtual patient trials using the models developed. The identified models have a median (90% range) absolute percentage error of 1.33% (0.08–7.20%). The median (90% range) absolute error was 0.12 mmol/liter (0.01–0.56 mmol/liter). The model and integral-based identification of S I captured all patient dynamics with low error, which would lead to more physiological behavior simulation. Conclusions: A simulation tool incorporating n = 40 virtual patient data sets to predict long-term glycemic control outcomes from clinical interventions was developed based on a physiological type 1 diabetes metabolic system model. The overall goal is to utilize this model and insulin sensitivity profiles to develop and optimize self-monitoring blood glucose and multiple daily injection therapy.">

        <tr id="Objective: Type-1 diabetes (T1D) treatment requires exogenous insulin administrations finely tuned based on glucose monitoring to avoid hyper/hypoglycemia. The safety and effectiveness of insulin treatments is commonly assessed in clinical trials, which are time demanding and expensive. These limitations can be overtaken by in silico clinical trials (ISCT) that require realistic patient and treatment models. The aim is to develop a T1D patient decision simulator usable to perform reliable ISCT. Methods: The T1D patient decision simulator was developed by connecting the UVA/Padova T1D model, which describes glucose, insulin, and glucagon kinetics, with modules describing glucose monitoring devices, like self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), the patient's behavior in making treatment decisions, and insulin administration. The reliability of the simulator was assessed by comparing its predictions with data collected in 44 T1D subjects using the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM sensor as an adjunct to the Bayer Contour Next USB SMBG device. Results: Metrics like time spent in eu/hypo/hyperglycemia of simulated data well match those observed in subjects. In particular, mean time in euglycemia, mean time in hyperglycemia, and median time in hypoglycemia are 61.75% versus 63.60% (p-value = 0.4825), 33.38% versus 33.40% (p -value = 0.9950), and 3.17% versus 2.14% (p-value = 0.1134), respectively, in real versus simulated data. Conclusion: The proposed simulator can be used to perform credible ISCT in realistic insulin treatment scenarios. Significance: The T1D patient decision simulator can be used to reliably assess novel insulin treatments, e.g., based on use of CGM only, in a realistic multiple-day scenario.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In silico trials in type 2 diabetes (T2D) would be useful for testing diabetes treatments and accelerating the development of new antidiabetic drugs. Here we present a T2D simulator able to reproduce the variability observed in a T2D population. The simulator also allows to safely experimenting on virtual subjects with severe (and possibly rare) pathological conditions.


METHODS
A meal simulation model of glucose, insulin and C-peptide systems, made of 15 differential equations and 39 parameters, has been identified using a system decomposition and forcing function Bayesian strategy on data of 51 T2D subjects undergoing a single triple-tracer mixed meal. One hundred T2D in silico subjects have been generated from the joint distribution of estimated model parameters. A case study is presented to illustrate the simulator use for testing a virtual drug (improving insulin action and secretion) in a subpopulation of rare, extremely impaired, T2D subjects.


RESULTS
The model well fitted T2D data and parameters were estimated with precision. Simulated plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide well matched the data (e.g., median [25th-75th percentile] glucose area under the curve of 6.9 [6.1-8.5] 104 mg/dL·min in silico vs. 7.0 [5.6-8.2] 104 mg/dL·min in vivo). The potential use of the simulator was shown in a case study, in which the (virtual) antidiabetic drug dose was optimized for very insulin-resistant T2D subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a T2D simulator that captures the behavior of T2D population during a meal, both in terms of average and inter-subject variability. The simulator represents a cost-effective way to test new antidiabetic drugs, before moving to human trials.">

        <tr id="Objectives: The goals of this study were to develop (1) a safe and effective protocol for the clinical control of type 1 diabetes using conventional self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements and multiple daily injections with insulin analogues, and (2) an in silico simulation tool of type 1 diabetes to predict long-term glycemic control outcomes of clinical interventions. Methods: The virtual patient method was used to develop a simulation tool for type 1 diabetes using data from a type 1 diabetes patient cohort (n = 40). The tool was used to test the adaptive protocol (AC) and a conventional intensive insulin therapy (CC) against results from a representative control cohort. Optimal and suboptimal basal insulin replacements were evaluated as a function of SMBG frequency in conjunction with the (AC and CC) prandial control protocols. Results: In long-term glycemic control, the AC protocol significantly decreased hemoglobin A1c in conditions of suboptimal basal insulin replacement for SMBG frequencies ≥6/day, and reduced the occurrence of mild and severe hypoglycemia by 86–100% over controls, over all SMBG frequencies in conditions of optimal basal insulin. Conclusions: A simulation tool to predict long-term glycemic control outcomes from clinical interventions has been developed to test a novel, adaptive control protocol for type 1 diabetes. The protocol is effective and safe compared to conventional intensive insulin therapy and controls. As fear of hypoglycemia is a large psychological barrier to glycemic control, the AC protocol may represent the next evolution of intensive insulin therapy to deliver increased glycemic control with increased safety. Further clinical or experimental validation is needed to fully prove the concept.">

The ability to simulate in silico experiments is crucial for fast and cost-effective preliminary studies prior to clinical trials. We present an in silico approach to the design of optimal pramlintide-to-insulin (P/I) ratios, using our computer simulator of the human metabolic system, with a population of virtual adult type 1 diabetes mellitus patients and with individual parameters modified to account for the dynamic effects of pramlintide.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A model of pramlintide action on gastric emptying was built using data of 15 type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects studied twice with a standardized dual-tracer meal on placebo and pramlintide, which was incorporated in our type 1 diabetes simulator. Extensive in silico experiments on 100 virtual subjects were performed to optimize the co-administration of pramlintide and insulin prior to its submission to clinical trials; several P/I ratios were tested in terms of efficacy, in attenuating postprandial hyperglycemia, and in hypoglycemia safety.


RESULTS
In silico experiments estimated the optimal P/I ratio to be 9 μg of pramlintide per unit (U) of insulin. Additional simulations narrowing the investigated range indicated that P/I ratios of 8 and 10 μg/U would achieve similar performance. Moreover, simulation results suggested that in clinical trials, insulin boluses should be reduced by approximately 21% at a P/I ratio of 9 μg/U to account for the effects of pramlintide and avoid postprandial hypoglycemia.


CONCLUSIONS
We can assert that a valid simulation model of pramlintide action was developed, leading to in silico estimation of optimal pramlintide:insulin co-administration ratio. Clinical trials will confirm (or adjust) this initial estimation.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Simulation models can contribute substantially to our understanding and ability to control the dynamic processes underlying impaired glucose metabolism in diabetic patients.


AIM
The aim of this paper is to outline a new comprehensive, physiologically-based dynamic model of glucose homeostasis incorporating up-to-date quantitative knowledge about glucose metabolism and its control by insulin and glucagon.


METHOD
The model is composed of three submodels for glucose, insulin, and glucagon.


RESULTS
The glucose submodel specifies the dynamics of glucose absorption following meals, hepatic glucose production and uptake, peripheral glucose uptake, kidney excretion, and insulin-independent uptake of glucose in the brain and red blood cells. The insulin submodel includes equations for insulin absorption, pancreatic insulin release and insulin clearance. The glucagon model specifies the hormone secretion and elimination kinetics. Algebraic equations are used to specify (i) how the hormones affect glucose production and utilisation in various compartments such as liver, muscle and fat tissues, and (ii) how glucose levels modify insulin and glucagon release from the pancreas. Setting the values of various model parameters is used to generate virtual individual patients.


CONCLUSIONS
The model allows the simulation of 24-hour blood glucose profiles for both insulin-dependent non-insulin dependent diabetic patients.">

        <tr id="Objective: Design and assessment of new therapies for type 1 diabetes (T1D) management can be greatly facilitated by in silico simulations. The ReplayBG simulation methodology here proposed allows “replaying” the scenario behind data already collected by simulating the glucose concentration obtained in response to alternative insulin/carbohydrate therapies and evaluate their efficacy leveraging the concept of digital twin. Methods: ReplayBG is based on two steps. First, a personalized model of glucose-insulin dynamics is identified using insulin, carbohydrate, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. Then, this model is used to simulate the glucose concentration that would have been obtained by “replaying” the same portion of data using a different therapy. The validity of the methodology was evaluated on 100 virtual subjects using the UVa/Padova T1D Simulator (T1DS). In particular, the glucose concentration traces simulated by ReplayBG are compared with those provided by T1DS in five different scenarios of insulin and carbohydrate treatment modifications. Furthermore, we compared ReplayBG with a state-of-the-art methodology for the scope. Finally, two case studies using real data are also presented. Results: ReplayBG simulates with high accuracy the effect of the considered insulin and carbohydrate treatment alterations, performing significantly better than state-of-art method in almost all considered situations. Conclusion: ReplayBG proved to be a reliable and robust tool to retrospectively explore the effect of new treatments for T1D on the glucose dynamics. It is freely available as open source software at https://github.com/gcappon/replay-bg. Significance: ReplayBG offers a new approach to preliminary evaluate new therapies for T1D management before clinical trials.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces the Type 1 Diabetes Simulator (T1DDS) and presents its potential in virtualization of type 1 diabetes mellitus therapy. The body of a person with type 1 diabetes does not produce insulin and this hormone must be supplied from the outside constantly to avoid death. Moreover, the insulin doses must be correct in order to minimize short- and long-term health complications. The dose determination is challenging due to the high dynamics of the insulin – glucose metabolic system. For the reason computer therapy aided systems have been developed for last decades to help solve the problem. Type 1 Diabetes Direct Simulator (T1DDS) is the author’s original computer program that imitates physiology of a type 1 diabetic. The aim of the simulator is to enable virtual medical interaction with such a patient within the scope of blood glucose level change after a meal intake and insulin administration. The paper illustrates the ideas behind the direct simulator. Describes and argues its model assumptions and explains its implementation. An exemplary application in medical education is presented and discussed as well.">

        <tr id="Background and aims Assessing algorithms of artificial pancreas systems is critical in developing automated and fault-tolerant solutions that work outside clinical settings. The development and evaluation of algorithms can be facilitated with a platform that conducts virtual clinical trials. We present in this paper a clinically validated cloud-based distributed platform that supports the development and comprehensive testing of single and dual-hormone algorithms for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods The platform is built on principles of object-oriented design and runs user algorithms in real-time virtual clinical trials utilizing a multi-threaded environment enabled by concurrent execution over a cloud infrastructure. The platform architecture isolates user algorithms located on personal machines from proprietary patient data running on the cloud. Users import a plugin into their algorithms (Matlab, Python, or Java) to connect to the platform. Once connected, users interact with a graphical interface to design experimental protocols for their trials. Protocols include trial duration in days, mealtimes and amounts, variability in mealtimes and amounts, carbohydrate counting errors, snacks, and onboard insulin levels. Results The platform facilitates development by solving the ODE model in the cloud on large CPU-optimized machines, providing a 62% improvement in memory, speed and CPU utilization. Users can easily debug & modify code, test multiple strategies, and generate detailed clinical performance reports. We validated and integrated into the platform a glucoregulatory system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized with clinical data to mimic the inter and intra-day variability of glucose responses of 15 T1DM patients. Conclusion The platform utilizes the validated patient model to conduct virtual clinical trials for the rapid development and testing of closed-loop algorithms for T1DM.">

        <tr id="Intraoperative glycemic control, particularly in cardiac surgical patients, remains challenging. Patients with impaired insulin sensitivity and/or secretion (i.e., type 1 diabetes mellitus) often manifest extremely labile blood glucose measurements during periods of stress and inflammation. Most current insulin infusion protocols are developed based on clinical experiences and consensus among a local group of physicians. Recent advances in human glucose metabolism modeling have established a computer model that invokes algorithms representing many of the pathways involved in glucose dysregulation for patients with diabetes. In this study, we used an FDA approved glucose metabolism model to evaluate an existing institutional intraoperative insulin infusion protocol via closed-loop simulation on the virtual diabetic population that comes with the computer model. A comparison of simulated responses to actual retrospective clinical data from 57 type 1 diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery managed by the institutional protocol was performed. We then designed a proportional-derivative controller that overcomes the weaknesses exhibited by our old protocol while preserving its strengths. In-silico evaluation results show that our proportional-derivative controller more effectively manages intraoperative hyperglycemia while simultaneously reducing hypoglycemia and glycemic variability. By performing in-silico simulation on intraoperative glucose and insulin responses, robust and seemingly efficacious algorithms can be generated that warrant prospective evaluation in human subjects.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: The UVLab platform - equipped with a metabolic model and 6062 virtual subjects (VS) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) - describes T2D heterogeneity. This work evaluates UVLab's ability to replicate the findings from a 26-week phase 3 clinical trial (NCT01336023) comparing degludec (IDeg), liraglutaide (Lira), and a fixed-ratio combination of the two (IDegLira).
 Methods: IDeg, Lira, and IDegLira were administered to the VS according to clinical trial protocol. Subpopulations matching early trial glycemic metrics were selected; later data were not used to inform the simulations. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), daily drug dose, and hypoglycemia events (HE) over the 26-week study were compared between clinical trial and simulations.
 Results: Subpopulations of 208, 283, and 417 VS for the IDeg, Lira, and IDegLira arm, respectively, were selected using a method matching mean and standard deviation of HbA1c, FPG, and HE from trial baseline, week-4, and week-8 (IDegLira only) data. Figure 1 shows the evolution of glycemic metrics, comparing clinical trial and simulations. Overall median absolute relative error across all metrics and arms was 2.6% [0.6-11%].
 Conclusion: UVLab effectively replicates trial outcomes, affirming its predictive capability for T2D treatment. This endorses in-silico models for treatment planning and enhancement of clinical trials.

        <tr id="Arguably, a minimally invasive system using subcutaneous (s.c.) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and s.c. insulin delivery via insulin pump would be a most feasible step to closed-loop control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Consequently, diabetes technology is focusing on developing an artificial pancreas using control algorithms to link CGM with s.c. insulin delivery. The future development of the artificial pancreas will be greatly accelerated by employing mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Realistic computer simulation is capable of providing invaluable information about the safety and the limitations of closed-loop control algorithms, guiding clinical studies, and out-ruling ineffective control scenarios in a cost-effective manner. Thus computer simulation testing of closed-loop control algorithms is regarded as a prerequisite to clinical trials of the artificial pancreas. In this paper, we present a system for in silico testing of control algorithms that has three principal components: (1) a large cohort of n = 300 simulated “subjects” (n = 100 adults, 100 adolescents, and 100 children) based on real individuals' data and spanning the observed variability of key metabolic parameters in the general population of people with T1DM; (2) a simulator of CGM sensor errors representative of Freestyle Navigator™, Guardian RT, or Dexcom™ STS™, 7-day sensor; and (3) a simulator of discrete s.c. insulin delivery via OmniPod Insulin Management System or Deltec Cozmo® insulin pump. The system has been shown to represent adequate glucose fluctuations in T1DM observed during meal challenges, and has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as a substitute to animal trials in the preclinical testing of closed-loop control strategies.">

        <tr id="In type 1 diabetes (T1D) exogenous insulin is administered to compensate for the absence of endogenous insulin production by pancreas beta-cells. T1D subjects must finely tune insulin doses to maintain blood glucose (BG) concentration within the normal range (70-180 mg/dl). For such a purpose, every day, T1D subjects need to frequently monitor their BG concentration and make several treatment decisions, e.g. the calculation of insulin and carbohydrate (CHO) doses to counterbalance, respectively, high and low BG values. The safety and effectiveness of T1D insulin therapies are normally assessed by clinical trials, which unfortunately are usually time-demanding, expensive and often present constraints of low numerosity and short duration, with consequently low probability of observing rare but risky situations, like severe hypoglycemia. These limitations can be overcome by the use of in silico clinical trials, based on computer simulations, that allow to test medical device-based treatments in a large number of subjects, over a long period, under reproducible conditions, at limited costs, and without implicating any risk for real subjects. A popular powerful tool to perform in silico clinical trials in T1D is the UVA/Padova T1D simulator, i.e. a model of glucose, insulin and glucagon dynamics in T1D subjects. However, to test insulin therapies in a real-life scenario, the UVA/Padova T1D simulator alone is not sufficient because a mathematical description of other fundamental components, like the device used for glucose monitoring and the patient's behavior in making treatment decisions, is required. 

The aim of this thesis is to design a mathematical model of T1D patients making treatment decisions fully usable for the comprehensive in silico assessment of insulin treatment scenarios. In particular, in the first part of the thesis we develop three submodels that the UVA/Padova T1D simulator requires (as complement) to pursue this scope. Specifically, we design a model of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) device, a model of minimally-invasive sensor for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and a model of the patient’s behavior in tuning CHO intakes and insulin doses according to SMBG and/or CGM measurements. The parameters of these models are either fitted on real data or derived from literature studies. The overall model, in the following called T1D decision-making (T1D-DM) model, can be used for several in silico experiments. To demonstrate its usefulness, in the second part of this thesis we apply the T1D-DM model to assess safety and effectiveness of nonadjunctive CGM use, i.e. the use of CGM measurements to make treatment decisions without requiring confirmatory SMBG measurements collected by fingerstick. This specific application is currently of great scientific and industrial interest for the diabetes technology research community because, until clinical evidence of its safety is provided, nonadjunctive CGM use cannot be approved by U.S. regulatory agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration. 

The thesis is organized in six chapters. In Chapter 1, after introducing T1D therapy, the importance of in silico clinical trials is discussed, both in general and specifically for the assessment of nonadjunctive CGM use. Then, some state-of-art simulation techniques are briefly introduced discussing their open problems. The aim of the thesis is illustrated at the end of the chapter. 

In Chapter 2, we analyse more in depth the limitations of the approaches currently available in the literature for the assessment of insulin treatments. In particular, we demonstrate that a recently proposed simulation method to "replay" in silico real-life treatment scenarios has domain of validity limited to small adjustments of basal insulin, calling for the development of more sophisticated techniques like that proposed in this thesis. 

In Chapter 3, our simulation method based on the T1D-DM model is presented. This model allows to simulate, in a real-life scenario, the glucose profiles of T1D subjects using SMBG and/or CGM to make treatment decisions. The T1D-DM model is composed of four components: A) the UVA/Padova T1D simulator, B) a model of glucose monitoring devices, C) a model of patient's behavior and treatment decisions and D) a model of the insulin pump. In particular, as far as B) is concerned, two different SMBG error models are derived by data collected with two popular SMBG devices (One Touch Ultra 2 and Bayer Contour Next USB). Using a recently published methodology which takes into account the main sensor error components, a CGM model is derived from data collected by a state-of-art CGM sensor (Dexcom G5 Mobile). Regarding C), a model of the patient's behavior in making treatment decisions based on SMBG and/or CGM, such as administration of insulin boluses and hypotreatments, is designed to simulate treatments based on i) SMBG, ii) adjunctive CGM, or iii) nonadjunctive CGM. In order to reproduce a real-life scenario, the model includes components describing the mistakes real subjects commonly make, such as miscalculation of meal CHO content and early/delayed insulin administrations. 

In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, two in silico trials based on the T1D-DM model are designed to assess nonadjunctive CGM use. In the first trial, nonadjunctive CGM is compared to SMBG and adjunctive CGM over a two-week period in 100 virtual subjects. Results show that the use of CGM (both adjunctive and nonadjunctive) significantly improves glycemic control compared to SMBG, while no significant change is observed between adjunctive CGM and nonadjunctive CGM. This suggests that CGM is ready to substitute SMBG for T1D treatment. In the second trial, the impact of thresholds used for CGM hypo/hyperglycemic alerts on the performance of nonadjunctive CGM use is assessed. Results show that time in hypoglycemia is reduced by nonadjunctive CGM use with any alert setting, while time in hyperglycemia is significantly worsen by nonadjunctive CGM use, compared to SMBG, when the high alert threshold is set to 350 mg/dl or higher. 

Finally, the major findings of the work carried out in this thesis, its possible applications and margin of improvements are summarized in Chapter 6.">

It is now an accepted knowledge that in silico trials can help to accelerate drug development and support treatment optimization. A T2D simulator (T2DS), consisting of a model of the glucose-insulin system and an in silico population describing glucose-insulin dynamics in T2D subjects, has been recently developed based on early-stage T2D data, studied with sophisticated experimental techniques. This limits the domain of validity of the simulator to this specific sub-population of T2D. Here we proposed a method for tuning the T2DS to any desired T2D target population, e.g. insulin-naïve (i.e., not experienced with insulin) patients, without the need to resort to complex and expensive clinical studies. This will allow to use the T2DS for testing treatments in the target population. To illustrate the methodology, we used a case study: extending the T2DS to reproduce the behavior of insulin-naïve T2D subjects. The methodology described here can be extended to other stages of T2D, allowing an extensive in silico testing phase of different treatments before human trials.">

        <tr id="A type 2 diabetes (T2D) simulator has been recently proposed for supporting drug development and treatment optimization. This tool consists of a physiological model of glucose/insulin/C-peptide dynamics and a virtual cohort of T2D subjects (i.e., random extractions of model parameterizations from a joint parameter distribution) well describing both average and variability realistic T2D dynamics . However, the state-of-art procedure to get a reliable virtual population requires some post-processing after subject extraction, in order to discard implausible behaviors. We propose an improved method for virtual subjects’ generation to overcome this burdensome task. To do so, we first assessed a refined joint parameter distribution, from which extracting a number of subjects, greater than the target population size. Then, target-size subsets are undersampled from the large cohort. The final virtual population is selected among the subsets as the one maximizing the similarity with T2D data and model parameter distribution, by means of measurement’ outcome metrics and Euclidian distance (Δ), respectively. In the final population, almost all the outcome metrics are statistically identical to the clinical counterparts (p-value>0.05) and model parameters’ distribution differs by ~5-10% from that derived from data. The methodology described here is flexible, thus resulting suitable for different T2D stages and type 1 diabetes, as well.Clinical Relevance— A straightforward subjects’ generation would ease the availability of tailored in silico trials for testing diabetes treatment in a specific population.">

        <tr id="Background: Computer simulation has been shown over the past decade to be a powerful tool to study the impact of medical devices characteristics on clinical outcomes. Specifically, in type 1 diabetes (T1D), computer simulation platforms have all but replaced preclinical studies and are commonly used to study the impact of measurement errors on glycemia. Method: We use complex mathematical models to represent the characteristics of 3 continuous glucose monitoring systems using previously acquired data. Leveraging these models within the framework of the UVa/Padova T1D simulator, we study the impact of CGM errors in 6 simulation scenarios designed to generate a wide variety of glycemic conditions. Assessment of the simulated accuracy of each different CGM systems is performed using mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) and precision absolute relative deviation (PARD). We also quantify the capacity of each system to detect hypoglycemic events. Results: The simulated Roche CGM sensor prototype (RCGM) outperformed the 2 alternate systems (CGM-1 & CGM-2) in accuracy (MARD = 8% vs 11.4% vs 18%) and precision (PARD = 6.4% vs 9.4% vs 14.1%). These results held for all studied glucose and rate of change ranges. Moreover, it detected more than 90% of hypoglycemia, with a mean time lag less than 4 minutes (CGM-1: 86%/15 min, CGM-2: 57%/24 min). Conclusion: The RCGM system model led to strong performances in these simulation studies, with higher accuracy and precision than alternate systems. Its characteristics placed it firmly as a strong candidate for CGM based therapy, and should be confirmed in large clinical studies.">

        <tr id="Plasma glucose and insulin responses following an oral glucose challenge are representative of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, key indicators of type 2 diabetes mellitus pathophysiology. A large heterogeneity in individuals’ challenge test responses has been shown to underlie the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention. Currently, this heterogeneity is overlooked due to a lack of methods to quantify the interconnected dynamics in the glucose and insulin time-courses. Here, a physiology-based mathematical model of the human glucose-insulin system is personalized to elucidate the heterogeneity in individuals’ responses using a large population of overweight/obese individuals (n = 738) from the DIOGenes study. The personalized models are derived from population level models through a systematic parameter selection pipeline that may be generalized to other biological systems. The resulting personalized models showed a 4-5 fold decrease in discrepancy between measurements and model simulation compared to population level. The estimated model parameters capture relevant features of individuals’ metabolic health such as gastric emptying, endogenous insulin secretion and insulin dependent glucose disposal into tissues, with the latter also showing a significant association with the Insulinogenic index and the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index, respectively.">

(GRG‐I) and Webber et al. (GRG‐II) is considered. Both are evaluated using a multi‐compartmental glucoregulatory model (IMPACT) and used to compare in‐vivo experimental data of therapeutic performance in rats and mice. For GRG‐I and GRG‐II, the total integrated glucose material balances are overestimated by 41.5% ± 14% and underestimated by 24.8% ± 16% compared to in‐vivo time‐course data, respectively. These large differences to the relatively simple computational descriptions of glucagon dynamics in the model, which underscores the urgent need for improved glucagon models is attributed. Additionally, therapeutic insulin and glucagon infusion pumps are modeled for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) human subjects to extend the results to additional datasets. These observations suggest that both the representative physiological and non‐physiological models considered in this work require additional refinement to successfully describe clinical data that involve simultaneous, coupled insulin, glucose, and glucagon dynamics.">

        <tr id="The large patient variability in human physiology and the effects of variables such as exercise or meals challenge current prediction modeling techniques. Physiological models are very precise but they are typically complex and specific physiological knowledge is required. In contrast, data-based models allow the incorporation of additional inputs and accurately capture the relationship between these inputs and the outcome, but at the cost of losing the physiological meaning of the model. In this work, we designed a hybrid approach comprising physiological models for insulin and grammatical evolution, taking into account the clinical harm caused by deviations from the target blood glucose by using a penalizing fitness function based on the Clarke error grid. The prediction models were built using data obtained over 14 days for 100 virtual patients generated by the UVA/Padova T1D simulator. Midterm blood glucose was predicted for the 100 virtual patients using personalized models and different scenarios. The results obtained were promising; an average of 98.31% of the predictions fell in zones A and B of the Clarke error grid. Midterm predictions using personalized models are feasible when the configuration of grammatical evolution explored in this study is used. The study of new alternative models is important to move forward in the development of alarm-and-control applications for the management of type 1 diabetes and the customization of the patient’s treatments. The hybrid approach can be adapted to predict short-term blood glucose values to detect continuous glucose-monitoring sensor errors and to estimate blood glucose values when the continuous glucose-monitoring system fails to provide them.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Computer simulators of human metabolism are powerful tools to design and validate new diabetes treatments. However, these platforms are often limited in the diversity of behaviors and glycemic conditions they can reproduce. Replay methodologies leverage field-collected data to create ad-hoc simulation environments representative of real-life conditions. After formal validations of our method in prior publications, we demonstrate its capacity to reproduce a recent clinical trial.


METHODS
Using the replay methodology, an ensemble of replay simulators was generated using data from a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing hybrid closed loop (HCL) and fully closed loop (FCL) control modalities in automated insulin delivery (AID), creating 64 subject/modality pairs. Each virtual subject was exposed to the alternate AID modality to compare the simulated vs observed glycemic outcomes. Equivalence tests were performed for time in, below, and above range (TIR, TBR, TAR) and glucose indexes (LBGI, HBGI) considering equivalence margins corresponding to clinical significance.


RESULTS
TIR, TAR, LBGI, and HBGI showed statistical and clinical equivalence between the original and the simulated data, TBR failed the equivalence test. For example, in HCL mode, simulated TIR was 84.89% vs. an observed 84.31% (p=0.0170, CI [-3.96,2.79]), and for FCL mode, TIR was 76.58% versus 77.41% (p=0.0222, CI [-2.54,4.20]).


CONCLUSION
Clinical trial data confirms the prior in-silico validation of the UVA replay method in predicting the glycemic impact of modified insulin treatments. This in-vivo demonstration justifies the application of the replay method to the personalization and adaptation of treatment strategies in people with T1D.">

Closed-loop systems consist of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin infusion pump, and a dosing algorithm that directs insulin delivery based on sensor levels. Testing of dosing algorithms in computer simulations may replace animal testing, accelerates development, and saves resources. We propose here a novel approach to generate a virtual population, to be used in metabolic simulators, from routine experimental data through the process that we term “stochastic e-cloning.” We build on a nonlinear physiologically motivated time-varying model of glucose regulation. We adopt the Bayesian approach to estimate model parameters and to obtain the joint posterior probability distribution of time-invariant and time-varying parameters with the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. The estimation process combines prior knowledge and experimental data to generate a sample from the posterior distribution, which can be subsequently used to conduct in silico experiments reflecting population and individual variability, and associated uncertainty as closely as possible. The approach is exemplified using data collected in 12 young subjects with type 1 diabetes. We demonstrate unbiased fit to the data, physiological plausibility of parameter estimates, and results of in silico testing using a stochastic virtual subject.">

        <tr id="Glucose is a major source of energy for the human body and it is essential that blood glucose levels are maintained within a safe range. Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the deficiency of insulin, a hormone which is secreted by the pancreas and is responsible for blood glucose regulation. Thus, T1D patients need exogenous insulin injections to keep the blood glucose level within a safe range. However, the post-prandial (PP) glucose regulation remains a challenging issue for diabetes treatment. In order to improve PP glucose concentrations, a data-driven modeling approach to adjust the meal-related insulin dose is proposed. Specifically, an individualized regression model able to correct the meal bolus computed with the conventional therapy is developed in order to handle the inter-patient variability characterising T1D patients that may affect PP glucose regulation. Moreover, the proposed approach exploits specific models for different day periods on the basis of the intra-day variability of insulin sensitivity. The individualized therapy is validated both on nominal and perturbed scenarios by using the UVA/PADOVA simulator, which is accepted by the FDA as a substitute for pre-clinical animal trials, and the results of a case study are reported.">

The code for the WWW version was written in Perl and relies heavily on previously completed work on the AIDA glucose-insulin simulator. AIDA on-line allows the user to make modifications in diet and insulin regimen for 40 different pre-programmed "patients" or to create a patient with custom-designed specifications. Multiple simulations can be run in order to compare the results of changes in diet and/or insulin regimen. The results of two different simulations can be displayed on the same graph.">

        <tr id="Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by a range of metabolic complications involving an individual's blood glucose levels, and its main regulator, insulin. These complications can vary largely from person to person depending on their current biophysical state. Biomedical research day-by-day makes strides to impact the lives of patients of a variety of diseases, including diabetes. One large stride that is being made is the generation of techniques to assist physicians to ``personalize medicine''. From available physiological data, biological understanding of the system, and dimensional analysis, a differential equation-based mathematical model was built in a sequential matter, to be able to elucidate clearly how each parameter correlates to the patient's current physiological state. We developed a simple mathematical model that accurately simulates the dynamics between glucose, insulin, and pancreatic $\beta$-cells throughout disease progression with constraints to maintain biological relevance. The current framework is clearly capable of tracking the patient's current progress through the disease, dependent on factors such as latent insulin resistance or an attrite $\beta$-cell population. Further interests would be to develop tools that allow the direct and feasible testing of how effective a given plan of treatment would be at returning the patient to a desirable biophysical state.">

        <tr id="Diabetes mellitus designates a range of metabolic disorders characterised by hyperglycaemia due to deficient or absent insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In particular, Type 1 diabetes is characterised by a total lack of endogenous insulin secretion which has to be replaced by exogenous insulin to control the plasma glucose concentration. An extracorporeal wearable artificial pancreas (AP) has been a research aim for over three decades. The research is motivated by the need to improve glucose control. Results of a major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), have demonstrated that improvements in glucose control prevent or delay long term complications, which are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Prior to a clinical evaluation, performance of new medical devices can be tested in silico. Such an approach has been adopted extensively by the pharmaceutical industry in the development of new drugs. In silica testing benefits from relatively low financial, human, and time costs by comparison with the resources required for a full clinical evaluation. The aims of the present thesis are to identify components of the AP, integrate them into a simulation environment, and design an in silico evaluation strategy for the development of closed-loop algorithms with the ultimate goal to assess safety and efficacy prior to clinical evaluation. In the present work, submodels of metabolic processes were linked to represent the characteristics of the glucoregulation in Type 1 diabetes. The submodels were associated with sets of parameters to account for variability in population and individual responses to meals and insulin therapy. The model of glucoregulation in Type 1 diabetes was extended by models of subcutaneous (sc) glucose sensing and sc insulin delivery to represent all aspects of the AP. A systematic approach was developed and employed to evaluate, in silica, the potential and limitations of an AP glucose controller. This was exemplified by evaluating a nonlinear model predictive controller. The robustness of the AP was explored by hypothesising various perturbations induced by different system components. A further objective included the establishment of a qualitative grading scheme of glucose control from the clinical viewpoint. This was followed by a comparison between results from simulations and a clinical trial of 24 hours, which gave the proof of concept of in silica testing. It was found that despite discrepancies due to initial conditions and meal differences, the simulations indicated well the outcome of the clinical trial. In conclusion, the thesis demonstrates the significant potential of in silica testing to make predictions about system behaviour aiding the assessment of safety and efficacy of control algorithms during the development of an AP.">

        <tr id="Managing Elderly type 2 diabetes (E-T2D) is challenging due to geriatric conditions (e.g., co-morbidity, multiple drug intake, etc.), and personalization becomes paramount for precision medicine. This paper presents a human digital twin (HDT) framework to manage E-T2D that exploits various patient-specific data and builds a suite of models exploiting the data for prediction and management to personalize diabetes treatment in E-T2D patients. These models include mathematical and deep-learning ones that capture different patient aspects. Consequently, the HDT virtualizes the patient from different viewpoints using an HDT that mimics the patient and has interfaces to update the virtual models simultaneously from measurements. Using these models the HDT obtains deeper insights about the patient. Further, an adaptive patient model fusing this information and a learning-based model predictive control (LB-MPC) algorithm are proposed. The geriatric conditions are captured as model parameters and constraints while solving the LB-MPC to personalize the insulin infusion for E-T2D management. The HDT is deployed on and illustrated with 15 patients using clinical trials and simulations. Our results show that HDT helps improve the time-in-range from 3–75% to 86–97% and reduces insulin infusion by 14–29%.">

        <tr id="This review examines the significant influence of Digital Twins (DTs) and their variant, Digital Human Twins (DHTs), on the healthcare field. DTs represent virtual replicas that encapsulate both medical and physiological characteristics—such as tissues, organs, and biokinetic data—of patients. These virtual models facilitate a deeper understanding of disease progression and enhance the customization and optimization of treatment plans by modeling complex interactions between genetic factors and environmental influences. By establishing dynamic, bidirectional connections between the DTs of physical objects and their digital counterparts, these technologies enable real-time data exchange, thereby transforming electronic health records. Leveraging the increasing availability of extensive historical datasets from clinical trials and real-world sources, AI models can now generate comprehensive predictions of future health outcomes for specific patients in the form of AI-generated DTs. Such models can also offer insights into potential diagnoses, disease progression, and treatment responses. This remarkable progression in healthcare paves the way for precision medicine and personalized health, allowing for high-level individualized medical interventions and therapies. However, the integration of DTs into healthcare faces several challenges, including data security, accessibility, bias, and quality. Addressing these obstacles is crucial to realizing the full potential of DHTs, heralding a new era of personalized, precise, and accurate medicine.">

        <tr id="A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity, with dynamic, bi-directional links between the physical entity and its corresponding twin in the digital domain. Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and in silico experiments and comparisons. They are poised to play a key role in formulating highly personalised treatments and interventions in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technology’s history and main concepts. A number of application examples of digital twins for personalised medicine, public health, and smart healthy cities are presented, followed by a brief discussion of the key technical and other challenges involved in such applications, including ethical issues that arise when digital twins are applied to model humans.">

        <tr id="Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects or systems. This new technology is increasingly being adopted in industry to improve the monitoring and efficiency of products and organizations. In healthcare, digital human twins (DHTs) represent virtual copies of patients, including tissues, organs, and physiological processes. Their application has the potential to transform patient care in the direction of increasingly personalized data-driven medicine. The use of DHTs can be integrated with digital twins of healthcare institutions to improve organizational management processes and resource allocation. By modeling the complex multi-omics interactions between genetic and environmental factors, DHTs help monitor disease progression and optimize treatment plans. Through digital simulation, DHT models enable the selection of the most appropriate molecular therapy and accurate 3D representation for precision surgical planning, together with augmented reality tools. Furthermore, they allow for the development of tailored early diagnosis protocols and new targeted drugs. Furthermore, digital twins can facilitate medical training and education. By creating virtual anatomy and physiology models, medical students can practice procedures, enhance their skills, and improve their understanding of the human body. Overall, digital twins have immense potential to revolutionize healthcare, improving patient care and outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing medical research and education. However, challenges such as data security, data quality, and data interoperability must be addressed before the widespread adoption of digital twins in healthcare. We aim to propose a narrative review on this hot topic to provide an overview of the potential applications of digital twins to improve treatment and diagnostics, but also of the challenges related to their development and widespread diffusion.">

        <tr id="Digital twins are virtual models of physical artefacts that may or may not be synchronously connected, and that can be used to simulate their behavior. They are widely used in several domains such as manufacturing and automotive to enable achieving specific quality goals. In the health domain, so-called digital patient twins have been understood as virtual models of patients generated from population data and/or patient data, including, for example, real-time feedback from wearables. Along with the growing impact of data science technologies like artificial intelligence, novel health data ecosystems centered around digital patient twins could be developed. This paves the way for improved health monitoring and facilitation of personalized therapeutics based on management, analysis, and interpretation of medical data via digital patient twins. The utility and feasibility of digital patient twins in routine medical processes are still limited, despite practical endeavors to create digital twins of physiological functions, single organs, or holistic models. Moreover, reliable simulations for the prediction of individual drug responses are still missing. However, these simulations would be one important milestone for truly personalized therapeutics. Another prerequisite for this would be individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing with subsequent obstacles, such as low automation, scalability, and therefore high costs. Additionally, regulatory challenges must be met thus calling for more digitalization in this area. Therefore, this narrative mini-review provides a discussion on the potentials and limitations of digital patient twins, focusing on their potential bridging function for personalized therapeutics and an individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing while also looking at the regulatory impacts.">

        <tr id="One of the most promising advancements in healthcare is the application of digital twin technology, offering valuable applications in monitoring, diagnosis, and development of treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. Furthermore, digital twins could also be helpful in finding novel treatment targets and predicting the effects of drugs and other chemical substances in development. In this review article, we consider digital twins as virtual counterparts of real human patients. The primary aim of this narrative review is to give an in-depth look into the various data sources and methodologies that contribute to the construction of digital twins across several healthcare domains. Each data source, including blood glucose levels, heart MRI and CT scans, cardiac electrophysiology, written reports, and multi-omics data, comes with different challenges regarding standardization, integration, and interpretation. We showcase how various datasets and methods are used to overcome these obstacles and generate a digital twin. While digital twin technology has seen significant progress, there are still hurdles in the way to achieving a fully comprehensive patient digital twin. Developments in non-invasive and high-throughput data collection, as well as advancements in modeling and computational power will be crucial to improve digital twin systems. We discuss a few critical developments in light of the current state of digital twin technology. Despite challenges, digital twin research holds great promise for personalized patient care and has the potential to shape the future of healthcare innovation.">

        <tr id="The concept of digital twins, widely adopted in industry, is entering healthcare. In this scoping review, we analysed definitions and characteristics of patient digital twins being developed for clinical use. Searching for studies claiming digital twin development/evaluation until August 2023, we identified 86 articles representing 80 unique claimed digital twins, nearly all (98%) in preclinical phases. From the analysis of definitions and characteristics, we propose to define patient digital twin as -a viewable digital replica of a patient, organ, or biological system that contains multidimensional, patient-specific information-. Two main forms were found: simulation digital twins using computational modelling of patient anatomy/physiology to run personalised outcome predictions and therapy evaluations, mostly for one-time assessments; and monitoring digital twins harnessing aggregated patient data for continuous risk/outcome forecasting over time and care optimisation. As patient digital twins rapidly emerge, the proposed definitions and subtypes offer a framework to guide research into realising the potential of these personalised, integrative technologies to advance clinical care.">

        <tr id="Digital twins have emerged as a groundbreaking concept in personalized medicine, offering immense potential to transform health care delivery and improve patient outcomes. It is important to highlight the impact of digital twins on personalized medicine across the understanding of patient health, risk assessment, clinical trials and drug development, and patient monitoring. By mirroring individual health profiles, digital twins offer unparalleled insights into patient-specific conditions, enabling more accurate risk assessments and tailored interventions. However, their application extends beyond clinical benefits, prompting significant ethical debates over data privacy, consent, and potential biases in health care. The rapid evolution of this technology necessitates a careful balancing act between innovation and ethical responsibility. As the field of personalized medicine continues to evolve, digital twins hold tremendous promise in transforming health care delivery and revolutionizing patient care. While challenges exist, the continued development and integration of digital twins hold the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine, ushering in an era of tailored treatments and improved patient well-being. Digital twins can assist in recognizing trends and indicators that might signal the presence of diseases or forecast the likelihood of developing specific medical conditions, along with the progression of such diseases. Nevertheless, the use of human digital twins gives rise to ethical dilemmas related to informed consent, data ownership, and the potential for discrimination based on health profiles. There is a critical need for robust guidelines and regulations to navigate these challenges, ensuring that the pursuit of advanced health care solutions does not compromise patient rights and well-being. This viewpoint aims to ignite a comprehensive dialogue on the responsible integration of digital twins in medicine, advocating for a future where technology serves as a cornerstone for personalized, ethical, and effective patient care.">

Digital twins are software replicas used in engineering to monitor a device and establish, for example, efficiency. Digital twins can also be used in medicine. Computational models can be personalized according to measurements taken from a patient for uses such as optimizing treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential use of digital twins for infections to improve diagnosis, make prognoses, and plan treatment. In a Perspective, Laubenbacher et al. discuss the challenges of building accurate models of the many systems and processes that are affected by infection that could be combined to form personalized digital twins.

        <tr id="Digital twins are computational models of complex systems, which aim to understand and optimize those systems more effectively than would be possible in real life. Ideally, digital twins can be translated to individual patients, to characterize and computationally treat their diseases with thousands of drugs, to select the drug or drugs that cure the patients. The background problem is that many patients do not respond adequately to drug treatment. This problem reflects a wide gap between the complexity of diseases and clinical practice. Each disease may involve altered interactions between thousands of genes that vary between different cell types in different organs. To our knowledge, these altered interactions have not been characterized on a genome-, cellulome-, and organ-wide scale in any disease. Thus, clinical translation of the digital twin ideal for predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory treatment involves formidable challenges, which are close to the limits of, or beyond today's technologies. Here, I discuss recent developments and challenges in relation to that ideal focusing on immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as examples from other diseases.">

        <tr id="The idea of a systematic digital representation of the entire known human pathophysiology, which we could call the Virtual Human Twin, has been around for decades. To date, most research groups focused instead on developing highly specialised, highly focused patient-specific models able to predict specific quantities of clinical relevance. While it has facilitated harvesting the low-hanging fruits, this narrow focus is, in the long run, leaving some significant challenges that slow the adoption of digital twins in healthcare. This position paper lays the conceptual foundations for developing the Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The VHT is intended as a distributed and collaborative infrastructure, a collection of technologies and resources (data, models) that enable it, and a collection of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that regulate its use. The VHT infrastructure aims to facilitate academic researchers, public organisations, and the biomedical industry in developing and validating new digital twins in healthcare solutions with the possibility of integrating multiple resources if required by the specific context of use. Healthcare professionals and patients can also use the VHT infrastructure for clinical decision support or personalised health forecasting. As the European Commission launched the EDITH coordination and support action to develop a roadmap for the development of the Virtual Human Twin, this position paper is intended as a starting point for the consensus process and a call to arms for all stakeholders.">

        <tr id="A digital twin is a virtual model developed to accurately reflect a physical thing or a system. In radiology, a digital twin of a radiological device enables developers to test its characteristics, make alterations to the design or materials, and test the success or failure of the modifications in a virtual environment. Innovative technologies, such as AI and -omics sciences, may build virtual models for patients that are continuously adjustable based on live-tracked health/lifestyle parameters. Accordingly, healthcare could use digital twins to improve personalized medicine. Furthermore, the accumulation of digital twin models from real-world deployments will enable large cohorts of digital patients that may be used for virtual clinical trials and population studies. Through their further refinement, development, and application into clinical practice, digital twins could be crucial in the era of personalized medicine, revolutionizing how diseases are detected and managed. Although significant challenges remain in the development of digital twins, a structural modification to the current operating models is occurring, and radiologists can guide the introduction of such technology into healthcare.">

        <tr id="Abstract Today's approach to medicine requires extensive trial and error to determine the proper treatment path for each patient. While many fields have benefited from technological breakthroughs in computer science, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the task of developing effective treatments is actually getting slower and more costly. With the increased availability of rich historical datasets from previous clinical trials and real‐world data sources, one can leverage AI models to create holistic forecasts of future health outcomes for an individual patient in the form of an AI‐generated digital twin. This could support the rapid evaluation of intervention strategies in silico and could eventually be implemented in clinical practice to make personalized medicine a reality. In this work, we focus on uses for AI‐generated digital twins of clinical trial participants and contend that the regulatory outlook for this technology within drug development makes it an ideal setting for the safe application of AI‐generated digital twins in healthcare. With continued research and growing regulatory acceptance, this path will serve to increase trust in this technology and provide momentum for the widespread adoption of AI‐generated digital twins in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Background The concept of digital twins, widely adopted in industry, is entering health care. However, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes the digital twin of a patient. Objective The objective of this scoping review was to analyze definitions and characteristics of patient digital twins being developed for clinical use, as reported in the scientific literature. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, IEEE, and Google Scholar for studies claiming digital twin development or evaluation until August 2023. Data on definitions, characteristics, and development phase were extracted. Unsupervised classification of claimed digital twins was performed. Results We identified 86 papers representing 80 unique claimed digital twins, with 98% (78/80) in preclinical phases. Among the 55 papers defining “digital twin,” 76% (42/55) described a digital replica, 42% (23/55) mentioned real-time updates, 24% (13/55) emphasized patient specificity, and 15% (8/55) included 2-way communication. Among claimed digital twins, 60% (48/80) represented specific organs (primarily heart: 15/48, 31%; bones or joints: 10/48, 21%; lung: 6/48, 12%; and arteries: 5/48, 10%); 14% (11/80) embodied biological systems such as the immune system; and 26% (21/80) corresponded to other products (prediction models, etc). The patient data used to develop and run the claimed digital twins encompassed medical imaging examinations (35/80, 44% of publications), clinical notes (15/80, 19% of publications), laboratory test results (13/80, 16% of publications), wearable device data (12/80, 15% of publications), and other modalities (32/80, 40% of publications). Regarding data flow between patients and their virtual counterparts, 16% (13/80) claimed that digital twins involved no flow from patient to digital twin, 73% (58/80) used 1-way flow from patient to digital twin, and 11% (9/80) enabled 2-way data flow between patient and digital twin. Based on these characteristics, unsupervised classification revealed 3 clusters: simulation patient digital twins in 54% (43/80) of publications, monitoring patient digital twins in 28% (22/80) of publications, and research-oriented models unlinked to specific patients in 19% (15/80) of publications. Simulation patient digital twins used computational modeling for personalized predictions and therapy evaluations, mostly for one-time assessments, and monitoring digital twins harnessed aggregated patient data for continuous risk or outcome forecasting and care optimization. Conclusions We propose defining a patient digital twin as “a viewable digital replica of a patient, organ, or biological system that contains multidimensional, patient-specific information and informs decisions” and to distinguish simulation and monitoring digital twins. These proposed definitions and subtypes offer a framework to guide research into realizing the potential of these personalized, integrative technologies to advance clinical care.">

        <tr id="Digital twins are made of a real-world component where data is measured and a virtual component where those measurements are used to parameterize computational models. There is growing interest in applying digital twins-based approaches to optimize personalized treatment plans and improve health outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence is critical in this process, as it enables the development of sophisticated disease models that can accurately predict patient response to therapeutic interventions. There is a unique and equally important application of AI to the real-world component of a digital twin when it is applied to medical interventions. The patient can only be treated once, and therefore, we must turn to the experience and outcomes of previously treated patients for validation and optimization of the computational predictions. The physical component of a digital twins instead must utilize a compilation of available data from previously treated cancer patients whose characteristics (genetics, tumor type, lifestyle, etc.) closely parallel those of a newly diagnosed cancer patient for the purpose of predicting outcomes, stratifying treatment options, predicting responses to treatment and/or adverse events. These tasks include the development of robust data collection methods, ensuring data availability, creating precise and dependable models, and establishing ethical guidelines for the use and sharing of data. To successfully implement digital twin technology in clinical care, it is crucial to gather data that accurately reflects the variety of diseases and the diversity of the population.">

        <tr id="Abstract In recent years, the integration of technological advancements and digitalization into healthcare has brought about a remarkable transformation in care delivery and patient management. Among these advancements, the concept of digital twins (DTs) has recently gained attention as a tool with substantial transformative potential in different clinical contexts. DTs are virtual representations of a physical entity (e.g., a patient or an organ) or systems (e.g., hospital wards, including laboratories), continuously updated with real-time data to mirror its real-world counterpart. DTs can be utilized to monitor and customize health care by simulating an individual’s health status based on information from wearables, medical devices, diagnostic tests, and electronic health records. In addition, DTs can be used to define personalized treatment plans. In this study, we focused on some possible applications of DTs in laboratory medicine when used with AI and synthetic data obtained by generative AI. The first point discussed how biological variation (BV) application could be tailored to individuals, considering population-derived BV data on laboratory parameters and circadian or ultradian variations. Another application could be enhancing the interpretation of tumor markers in advanced cancer therapy and treatments. Furthermore, DTs applications might derive personalized reference intervals, also considering BV data or they can be used to improve test results interpretation. DT’s widespread adoption in healthcare is not imminent, but it is not far off. This technology will likely offer innovative and definitive solutions for dynamically evaluating treatments and more precise diagnoses for personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Digital society strategies in healthcare include the rapid development of digital twins (DTs) for patients and human organs in medical research and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical practice to develop effective treatments in a cheaper, quicker, and more effective manner. This is facilitated by the availability of large historical datasets from previous clinical trials and other real-world data sources (e.g., patient biometrics collected from wearable devices). DTs can use AI models to create predictions of future health outcomes for an individual patient in the form of an AI-generated digital twin to support the rapid assessment of in silico intervention strategies. DTs are gaining the ability to update in real time in relation to their corresponding physical patients and connect to multiple diagnostic and therapeutic devices. Support for this form of personalized medicine is necessary due to the complex technological challenges, regulatory perspectives, and complex issues of security and trust in this approach. The challenge is also to combine different datasets and omics to quickly interpret large datasets in order to generate health and disease indicators and to improve sampling and longitudinal analysis. It is possible to improve patient care through various means (simulated clinical trials, disease prediction, the remote monitoring of apatient’s condition, treatment progress, and adjustments to the treatment plan), especially in the environments of smart cities and smart territories and through the wider use of 6G, blockchain (and soon maybe quantum cryptography), and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as through medical technologies, such as multiomics. From a practical point of view, this requires not only efficient validation but also seamless integration with the existing healthcare infrastructure.">

This will be realized based on advances in high performance computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a path forward. Given the rapidly growing interest in patient digital twins, this manuscript provides a valuable early progress report of several CPDT pilot projects commenced in common, their overall aims, early progress, lessons learned and future directions that will increasingly involve the broader research community.">

With the growth of clinical trial databases captured by Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, there is a growing interest in using machine learning models to generate digital twins. This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data.

        <tr id="Abstract   This research addresses the legal challenges posed by the implementation of digital twin technology in public health. Digital twins are advanced computational models which aim to replicate human organ functions and biological processes. Their goal is to enable the simulation of the entire human body and to personalize the outputs with individual patient’s health data. Digital twin technology promises to bridge gap between personalized medicine and precision public health. This research is based on a comprehensive review of the current European and Swiss legal frameworks for medical devices and data protection that apply to digital twin technology. Within these frameworks, digital twins are in a grey area, as they are only considered as medical device software when applied to individuals. They also incorporate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which are already a source of legal concern in a healthcare setting, but their effective use in public health raises additional issues. Preliminary findings suggest significant shortcomings in the legal frameworks regarding data privacy, and the potential for increased surveillance by health insurance systems, which could lead to human rights violations. The public health application of digital twins would require global data analysis of sensitive personal information, raising further questions about the secure storage, transmission, and processing of this data. The study concludes that current legal frameworks must be future proofed to manage the complexities introduced by digital twins in public health. In particular, it suggests that regulatory oversight of medical devices needs to be significantly improved in order to safely harness the potential of digital twin technologies for public health. Finally, the new European Union health data space and the forthcoming EU AI act will also play important roles in the implementation of digital twin technologies. Key messages • Applying digital twin technology in public health faces considerable challenges, particularly the issues around data privacy, potential discrimination, and increased surveillance. • We need to adapt and strengthen existing legal frameworks to effectively manage the complexities introduced by digital twins, ensuring that these technologies can be safely used for public health.">

This article presents one of the first attempts to use digital twins in this capacity and represents an amalgamation of three key domains: clinical, digital health, and computer science, respectively.">

        <tr id="Personalized computer simulations of infection could allow more effective treatments When the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic emerged in 2019, researchers rapidly recalibrated epidemiological computer models originally developed for other pandemics to serve as decision support tools for policy-makers and health care professionals planning public health responses. However, no current tools can predict the course of disease and help a doctor decide on the most appropriate treatment for an individual COVID-19 patient. “Digital twins” are software replicas of the dynamic function and failure of engineered products and processes. The medical analog, patient-specific digital twins, could integrate known human physiology and immunology with real-time patient-specific clinical data to produce predictive computer simulations of viral infection and immune response. Such medical digital twins could be a powerful addition to our arsenal of tools to fight future pandemics, combining mechanistic knowledge, observational data, medical histories, and the power of artificial intelligence (AI).">

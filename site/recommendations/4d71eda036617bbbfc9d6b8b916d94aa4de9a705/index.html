        <tr id="The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23, 2020, was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.">

        <tr id="With the large-scale outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, scientists and medical workers around the world made contributions to reducing the epidemic outbreak, curing patients, and developing vaccines against the epidemic. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in various countries, many scholars have used machine learning and infectious disease dynamics models to make corresponding predictions for the subsequent development of the epidemic. In order to acquire a more accurate forecast of the global epidemic, this paper used the ARIMA model, Logistic model, SIR model, and improved SEIR model to make predictions. Moreover, we compared these models’ benefits, drawbacks, and the degree of fit between the predicted data of various models and the real data to obtain a highly accurate model. Experiments have proved that among these models, the improved SEIR model can predict the future development trend of the global epidemic more precisely. In addition, the improved SEIR model also provides a certain theoretical basis for the government to issue a series of policies, prevention methods and control measures.">

        <tr id="Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks. Interpretation: The COVID-19 outbreak is controllable in the foreseeable future if comprehensive and stringent control measures are taken.">

 Initially found at Hubei, Wuhan and identified as a novel virus of coronavirus family by WHO, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with an exponentially speed, causing millions of death and public fear. Currently, COVID19 has brought a secondary wave within U.S., India, Brazil and other parts of the world. However, its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear from the medical, mathematical and pharmaceutical aspects. Classical Suspect-Infection-Recovery model has limitations to describe the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it becomes necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infected cases in U.S. In this article, a dynamic model called RLIM based on classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections with a dynamic secondary infection rate ω in assumption. An intermediate state called SI is introduced between recovery and infection statues to record the number of secondary infected cases from a latent period of recovery. Compared with other models, RLIM fits historical recovery cases and utilizes them to predict future infections. Because RLIM utilizes multiple information sources, and provides error back propagation schematics, it is reasonable to assert that its predictions are more accurate and persuasive. Projections of four U.S. COVID19 states show that with the secondary infectious rate ω varies from 0.01 to 0.3 within a latent period of 14 days chosen, RLIM can predict the newly infected number from January 15 to February 15, 2021 with AFER lower to 14%. It also successfully estimates the turning point of New Yorks infections in January 2021, based on current data records.">

        <tr id="As of May 1, 2020, the number of cases of Covid-19 in the US passed 1,062,446, interventions to slow down the spread of Covid-19 curtailed most social activities. Meanwhile, an economic crisis and resistance to the strict intervention measures are rising. Some researchers proposed intermittent social distancing that may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022. Questions arise about whether we should maintain or relax quarantine measures. We developed novel artificial intelligence and causal inference integrated methods for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear epidemic systems. We estimated that the peak time of the Covid-19 in the US would be April 24, 2020 and its outbreak in the US will be over by the end of July and reach 1,551,901 cases. We evaluated the impact of relaxing the current interventions for reopening economy on the spread of Covid-19. We provide tools for balancing the risks of workers and reopening economy.">

        <tr id="In December 2019, Wuhan City, China, discovered a new infectious disease, COVID-19. Over 70 million people have been infected and one million people have died as a result of COVID-19. Defeating such a deadly, infectious disease requires accurate models that predict COVID-19 outbreaks. Using prediction models, governments can plan budgets and facilities for fighting diseases, and take control measures to make better decisions and take control measures. For example, they can determine how many medicines and medical equipment to manufacture or import, as well as how many medical personnel are needed to fight the disease. The COVID-19 outbreak has subsequently been predicted in several countries and continents using regression and classification models. A recent study that incorporated statistical and machine learning techniques was reviewed to predict COVID-19 outbreaks in the future. Ground truth datasets are used, their characteristics are investigated, models are developed, predictor variables are identified, statistical and machine learning methods are applied, performance metrics are calculated, and finally comparisons are made. By applying machine learning methods, the survey results indicate that we can make predictions about whether a patient will become infected with COVID-19, how outbreak trends will develop, and which age groups will be affected the most">

        <tr id="In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to R(t) 1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 epidemic has brought great external impact to China. China is facing complex internal and external environmental challenges. SIR epidemic model is a classical partition model, which is widely used to predict the progress of COVID-19. Although the SIR model may be useful in simulating multiple epidemics, it may not be sufficient to describe the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, some modifications were made and used to study the spread and control of COVID-19 epidemic on the SIR model of COVID-19 disease. Expand it by increasing the link between tracking and other interventions. By studying the SEIR model considering the interaction between human and infectious source. In this paper, we will use the classical SIR model to simulate and predict the spread of COVID-19. By distinguishing between confirmed and undiagnosed individuals, the development of COVID-19 is characterized by phased changes. Based on the preliminary data analysis of the epidemic on various industries, the actual impact of the epidemic on society was quantitatively analyzed.">

One of the major obstacles for making accurate predictions is imperfect available data on the current state of the disease dynamics typically summarized via the number of infected and recovered cases, and disease-related deaths. In the case of rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, major challenges include under-reporting of infected and recovered cases due to the shortage of available tests, non-uniform performance and not suﬃciently high sensitivity/speciﬁcity of currently available tests, a long incubation period, and a signiﬁcant number of asymptomatic/unconﬁrmed cases, inconsistent accounting practices in death classiﬁcation. All these make it quite challenging to accurately predict the future trajectory of this pandemic.">

As of April 16, 2020, COVID-19 has become a pandemic and is aﬀecting over 200 countries and regions in all continents except Antarctica. Modeling of COVID-19 data is of great importance, because it can provide insight into the dynamics of the spread of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes the COVID disease, and the eﬀects of mitigation policies. Such insight is helpful for health workers and policy makers to evaluate potential interventions and make forecast about the future trend of the virus spread. This is exactly the aim of Wang et al. In addition, we appreciate the authors’ eﬀort in providing an R package eSIR , which facilitates the data analysis using the proposed model. In what follows, we comment on the modeling approach taken by Wang et al. and suggest future directions for this area of research.">

Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data. On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.">

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.">

To this effect, we applied SusceptibleInfectiveRecovered/Removed (SIR) epidemiological model on the disease.

The evolution of the disease spread with the Mathematical SIR model and Machine Learning regression model for time series forecasting of the COVID-19 data without, and with lags and trends, was able to capture the early spread of the disease.

We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic.

Using the present COVID-19 pandemic as a guide, the researchers suggest a hybrid model architecture for analyzing and optimizing COVID-19 data during the complete country. The analysis of COVID-19's exploration and death rate uses an ARIMA model with susceptible-infectious-removed and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models. The logistic model's failure to forecast the number of confirmed diagnoses and the snags of the SEIR model's too many tuning parameters are both addressed by a hybrid model method. Logistic regression (LR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are utilized for the same purpose. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error are used to show these models. New COVID-19 cases, the number of quarantines, mortality rates, and the deployment of public self-protection measures to reduce the epidemic are all outlined in the study's findings.

While over a million of literature have been produced on these unprecedented, overwhelming global disaster, one critical question is open: How has COVID-19 been quantified globally? This further inspires many other questions: What COVID-19 problems have been modeled? How have modeling methods in areas such as epidemiology, artificial intelligence (AI), data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science played their roles in characterizing COVID-19? Where are the gaps and issues of these COVID-19 modeling studies? What are the lessons for quantifying future disasters? Answering these questions involves the analysis of a very broad spectrum of literature across different disciplines and domains. Distinguishing from specific efforts, this review takes the first attempt to generate a systematic, structured and contrastive landscape and taxonomy of global COVID-19 modeling. First, the surveyed problems span over a full range of COVID-19, including epidemic transmission processes, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions and their influence, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. Second, the reviewed modeling methods traverse all relevant disciplines, from statistic modeling to epidemic modeling, medical analysis, biomedical analysis, AI, deep and machine learning, analytics, and simulation. Critical analyses further identify significant issues and gaps, for example, simple techniques and similar problems have been overwhelmingly addressed everywhere, while intrinsic and foundational issues and deep insights have been overlooked. The review discloses significant opportunities for more deeply, effectively and uniquely quantifying COVID-19-like global disasters from their intrinsic working mechanisms, interactions and dynamics.">

In addition, in order to improve the accuracy, this paper focused on the cumulative features. With employing the algorithm mentioned above, this paper tried to find out the model that fits the training data by calculating the mean square error (MSE) or coefficient of determination (R}}2) to evaluate the models.

What’s more, for states data, they are divided into different categories and added with the Time-Lag matrix. The features are selected at the same time.

        <tr id="The unprecedented and overwhelming SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease significantly challenge our life and the society and economy. Many questions emerge, a critical one is to quantify the challenges, realities, intervention effect and influence of the pandemic. With the massive effort in modeling COVID-19, what COVID-19 issues have been modeled? what and how well have epidemiology, AI, data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science characterized the COVID-19 epidemic? what are the gaps and opportunities of quantifying the pandemic? Such questions involve a wide body of knowledge and literature, unclear but important for the present and future health crisis quantification. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the challenges, tasks, methods, progress, gaps and opportunities in relation to modeling COVID-19 processes, data, mitigation and impact. With a research landscape of COVID-19 modeling, we further categorize, summarize, compare and discuss the related methods and progress of modeling COVID-19 epidemic transmission processes and dynamics, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, nonpharmaceutical interventions and their effects, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. The review shows how modeling methods such as mathematical and statistical models, domain-driven modeling by epidemiological compartmental models, medical and biomedical analysis, AI and data science in particular shallow and deep machine learning, simulation modeling, social science methods and hybrid modeling have addressed the COVID-19 challenges and what gaps and directions exist for better futures.">

        <tr id="We propose a new epidemic model (SuEIR) for forecasting the spread of COVID-19, including numbers of confirmed and fatality cases at national and state levels in the United States. Specifically, the SuEIR model is a variant of the SEIR model by taking into account the untested/unreported cases of COVID-19, and trained by machine learning algorithms based on the reported historical data. Besides providing basic projections for confirmed and fatality cases, the proposed SuEIR model is also able to predict the peak date of active cases, and estimate the basic reproduction number (R0). In particular, the forecasts based on our model suggest that the peak date of the US, New York state, and California state are 06/01/2020, 05/10/2020, and 07/01/2020 respectively. In addition, the estimated R0 of the US, New York state, and California state are 2.5, 3.6 and 2.2 respectively. The prediction results for all states in the US can be found on our project website: https://covid19.uclaml.org, which are updated on a weekly basis, and have been adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for COVID-19 death forecasts (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).">

A modified auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics is developed and applied to the surveillance data of cumulative and new Covid-19 cases and deaths from WHO, as of March 16, 2020. The average errors of 5-step forecasting were 2.5%. The total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with later intervention (comprehensive public health intervention is implemented 4 weeks later) could reach 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively. The case ending time was January 10, 2021. However, the total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with one week later intervention were reduced to 951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the Covid-19 spread would be reduced from 356 days to 232 days. The case ending time was September 8, 2020. We observed that delaying intervention for one month caused the maximum number of cumulative cases to increase 166.89 times, and the number of deaths increase from 53,560 to 8,938,725.

After statistical testing, the ARIMA model and the improved ARIMAX model based on feature selection quickly solves the development trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the short-term;Result: The implementation of the computer program shows that the traditional ARIMAmodel cannot predict the cumulative number of COVID-19 diagnoses in the United States well, and the improved ARIMAX model using features based on stepwise regression can accurately predict the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States under the 95% confidence interval. The U.S. epidemic will show a clear upward trend in the next 60 days, and in mid-March the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses in the country is about 3,724,000, and the cumulative death toll is about 476,000, and the number of people in the ICU ward is about 22,118. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

It has claimed more than 50,000 lives worldwide and more than one million of people have been infected as of 04th April 2020. In Sri Lanka, the first case of COVI19 was reported late January 2020 was a Chinese national and the first local case was identified in the second week of March. Since then, the government of Sri Lanka introduced various sequential measures to improve social distancing such as closure of schools and education institutes, introducing work from home model to reduce the public gathering, introducing travel bans to international arrivals and more drastically, imposed island wide curfew expecting to minimize the burden of the disease to the Sri Lankan health system and the entire community. Currently, there are 159 cases with five fatalities and also reported that 24 patients are recovered and discharged from hospitals. In this study, we use the SEIR conceptual model and its modified version by decomposing infected patients into two classes; patients who show mild symptoms and patients who tend to face severe respiratory problems and are required to treat in intensive care units. We numerically simulate the models for about five months period considering three critical parameters of COVID transmission mainly in the Sri Lankan context; efficacy of control measures, rate of overseas imported cases and time to introduce social distancing measures by the respective authorities.">

This modified SEIR model was applied on the available initial spread data until June 25th, 2021 for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Without lockdown in Jordan, the analysis demonstrates potential infection to roughly 3.1 million people during the peak of spread approximately 3 months, starting from the date of lockdown (March 21st). Conversely, the present partial lockdowns strategy by the Kingdom was expected to reduce the predicted number of infections to 0.5 million in 9 months period. The analysis also demonstrates the ability of stricter lockdowns to effectively flatten the graph curve of COVID-19 in Jordan. Our modified SEIR and deep neural network (DNN) model were efficient in the prediction of COVID-19 epidemic sizes and peaks. The measures taken to control the epidemic by the government decreased the size of the COVID-19 epidemic.">

 BACKGROUND
 The COVID-19 pendemic reached more than 200 countries, which was recognized during December-19 from CHINA and affected more than 28 lakh people on date April 26, 2020 (data source:Johns Hopkins Corona Virus Resource Center).


 OBJECTIVE
 We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until July 2, 2020) using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA).


 METHODS
 Here we have used the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Mathematical approaches are widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and parameters of COVID-19. Methods such as epidemic curve fitting, surveillance data during the early transmission R0, and other epidemic models are frequently applied to generate forecasts of COVID-19 pandemic across the world.


 RESULTS
 Our analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran, entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) is come as a surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020.


 CONCLUSIONS
 Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed at global level and extracted data upon Machine Learning approach using Artificial intelligence techniques for top 10% or 20 countries.

        <tr id="Epidemiological models can provide the dynamic evolution of a pandemic but they are based on many assumptions and parameters that have to be adjusted over the time when the pandemic lasts. However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and forecasting with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to forecast the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately predict the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYC's government's website. In addition, we employ the calibrated data-driven model to study the effects of vaccination and timing of reopening indoor dining in NYC.">

        <tr id="We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until April 30, 2020) using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Our analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran, entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) will come as a surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020. Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis and has severely impacted the economy and daily life of people. Predicting the spread of COVID-19 is of utmost importance to effectively control the spread of the disease. In this study, we propose a COVID-19 prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression algorithms. We collected data on the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths caused by COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2023. We divided the data into training and testing datasets and applied feature engineering techniques to extract relevant features. We then trained our model using SVM and Linear Regression algorithms on the training dataset. The results of our experiments show that the SVM model achieved little bit less accuracy than the Linear Regression model in predicting the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Our model can provide accurate predictions and insights into the future trends of COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus pandemic first started in Wuhan, China. The pandemic then spread rapidly all over the world. The virus wreaked unprecedented havoc worldwide. Researchers are using a variety of mathematical and machine learning-based prediction models to predict the future trend of the pandemic. In this study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to forecast the expected daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for the next two weeks in the United States (USA) and India, which are most affected by the pandemic. ARIMA (0,2,1) and ARIMA (1,2,3) models with the lowest mean absolute percent error (MAPE) were selected as the best models for USA and India, respectively (MAPEUSA=1.04%, MAPEINDIA=0.41%). According to these models, it is predicted that the total number of cases in the USA will be 27.201 million and 10.788 million in India on February 04, 2021. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. Analysis results can shed light on understanding the trends of the pandemic in these countries.">

        <tr id="A quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection can streamline and accelerate the development of novel medicines to treat COVID-19. Simulation of clinical trials allows in silico exploration of the uncertainties of clinical trial design and can rapidly inform their protocols. We previously published a preliminary model of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further our understanding of COVID-19 and treatment, we significantly updated the model by matching a curated dataset spanning viral load and immune responses in plasma and lung. We identified a population of parameter sets to generate heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment and tested this model against published reports from interventional SARS-CoV-2 targeting mAb and antiviral trials. Upon generation and selection of a virtual population, we match both the placebo and treated responses in viral load in these trials. We extended the model to predict the rate of hospitalization or death within a population. Via comparison of the in silico predictions with clinical data, we hypothesize that the immune response to virus is log-linear over a wide range of viral load. To validate this approach, we show the model matches a published subgroup analysis, sorted by baseline viral load, of patients treated with neutralizing Abs. By simulating intervention at different time points post infection, the model predicts efficacy is not sensitive to interventions within five days of symptom onset, but efficacy is dramatically reduced if more than five days pass post symptom onset prior to treatment.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.">

        <tr id="In the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, public health strategies tend to gravitate towards non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) given the time required to develop targeted treatments and vaccines. One of the most common NPIs is Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI). One of the factors determining the effectiveness of TTI is the ability to identify contacts of infected individuals. In this study, we propose a multi-layer temporal contact network to model transmission dynamics and assess the impact of different TTI implementations, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. The model was used to evaluate TTI effectiveness both in containing an outbreak and mitigating the impact of an epidemic. We estimated that a TTI strategy based on home isolation and testing of both primary and secondary contacts can contain outbreaks only when the reproduction number is up to 1.3, at which the epidemic prevention potential is 88.2% (95% CI: 87.9%-88.5%). On the other hand, for higher value of the reproduction number, TTI is estimated to noticeably mitigate disease burden but at high social costs (e.g., over a month in isolation/quarantine per person for reproduction numbers of 1.7 or higher). We estimated that strategies considering quarantine of contacts have a larger epidemic prevention potential than strategies that either avoid tracing contacts or require contacts to be tested before isolation. Combining TTI with other social distancing measures can improve the likelihood of successfully containing an outbreak but the estimated epidemic prevention potential remains lower than 50% for reproduction numbers higher than 2.1.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an outbreak in 2002-2003, spreading to 29 countries with a mortality rate of about 10%. Strict quarantine and infection control methods quickly stopped the spread of the disease. Later research showed that SARS-CoV came from animals (zoonosis) and stressed the possibility of a similar spread from host to human, which was clearly shown by the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic, instigated by SARS-CoV-2, has affected 776 million confirmed cases and more than seven million deaths globally as of Sept 15, 2024. The existence of animal reservoirs of coronaviruses continues to pose a risk of re-emergence with improved fitness and virulence. Given the high death rate (up to 70 percent) and the high rate of severe sickness (up to 68.7 percent in long-COVID patients), it is even more critical to identify new therapies as soon as possible. This study combines research on antivirals that target SARS coronaviruses that have been conducted over the course of more than twenty years. It is a beneficial resource that might be useful in directing future studies.">

        <tr id="We engaged with health sector stakeholders and public health professionals within the health system through a participatory modeling approach to support policy-making in the early COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan, Canada. The objective was to use simulation modeling to guide the implementation of public health measures and short-term hospital capacity planning to mitigate the disease burden from March to June 2020. We developed a hybrid simulation model combining System Dynamics (SD), discrete-event simulation (DES), and agent-based modeling (ABM). SD models the population-level transmission of COVID-19, ABM simulates individual-level disease progression and contact tracing intervention, and DES captures COVID-19-related hospital patient flow. We examined the impact of mixed mitigation strategies—physical distancing, testing, conventional and digital contact tracing—on COVID-19 transmission and hospital capacity for a worst-case scenario. Modeling results showed that enhanced contact tracing with mass testing in the early pandemic could significantly reduce transmission, mortality, and the peak census of hospital beds and intensive care beds. Using a participatory modeling approach, we not only directly informed policy-making on contact tracing interventions and hospital surge capacity planning for COVID-19 but also helped validate the effectiveness of the interventions adopted by the provincial government. We conclude with a discussion on lessons learned and the novelty of our hybrid approach.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
China implemented a dynamic zero-COVID strategy to curb viral transmission in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This strategy was designed to inhibit mutation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. This study explores the dynamics of viral evolution under stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) through real-world observations.


METHODOLOGY
Our analysis encompassed all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 780) from two consecutive outbreaks occurring in July to August 2021. Epidemiological investigations and in-depth viral genome analyses were conducted to determine the sources of infection and the inter-outbreak linkages.


RESULTS
The outbreaks likely originated via contaminated objects from an imported COVID-19 case to local airport cleaners. Most patients presented clinically mild symptoms. All viral genomes clustered into a single clade, with genomes from the subsequent Yangzhou outbreak forming a distinct branch, diverging from those of the initial Nanjing outbreak. Compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, the Delta variants isolated from the imported case and early local cases in Nanjing had 35 nucleotide mutations and three deletions. Various single nucleotide variant (SNV) combinations were observed in subsequent transmissions, with NPIs accounting for the termination of 67.2% (92/137) of SNV combinations. Stringent implementation of NPIs resulted in a greater number of terminated SNV combinations than emerging ones. Additionally, vaccination of cases was associated with SNV combination termination.


CONCLUSIONS
This study underscores the significant role of NPIs in preventing the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 mutations.">

        <tr id="Introduction A well-connected transportation network unites localities but also accelerates the transmission of infectious diseases. Subways—an important aspect of daily travel in big cities—are high-risk sites for the transmission of urban epidemics. Intensive research examining the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases in subways is necessary to ascertain the risk of disease transmission encountered by commuters. Methods In this study, we improve the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered (SEIR) model and propose the susceptible–exposed–infected–asymptomatic infected (SEIA) model. First, we added asymptomatic patients to the improved model as a parameter to explore the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of infectious diseases in a subway. The numbers of boarding and alighting passengers were added to the model as two time-varying parameters to simulate the exchange of passengers at each station. Results The improved model could simulate the transmission of infectious diseases in subways and identify the key factors of transmission. We then produced an example of the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a subway using real subway passenger data substituted into the model for the calculations. Discussion We ascertained that the number of exposed people continuously increased with the operation of the subway. Asymptomatic patients had a greater impact on the transmission of infectious diseases than infected people in the course of transmission. The SEIA model constructed in this study accurately determined the spread of infectious diseases in a subway and may also be applicable to studies on the transmission of infectious diseases in other urban public transport systems.">

Practical relevance of a thorough knowledge of the transmission pathways and related mechanisms of infectious diseases are complex.

Designing corresponding models based on specific transmission mechanisms can more realistically depict the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and provide higher accuracy for parameter estimation. This study suggested an enhanced SEIR model and performed a comprehensive investigation of its equilibrium point and stability, acknowledging that individuals infected with the novel coronavirus are contagious in time of their incubation period. Consequently, an empirical investigation was undertaken utilizing this model to analyze the overall trend of the epidemic in China and the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Key model parameters, such as the infection rate coefficient, control coefficient, basic reproduction number, and the particular time at which the effective reproduction number declines to 1, were ascertained by the maximum likelihood estimation approach.

        <tr id="The current situation of COVID-19 measures makes it difficult to accurately assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 due to a decrease in reporting rates, leading to missed initial transmission events and subsequent outbreaks. There is growing recognition that wastewater virus data assist in estimating potential infections, including asymptomatic and unreported infections. Understanding the COVID-19 situation hidden behind the reported cases is critical for decision-making when choosing appropriate social intervention measures. However, current models implicitly assume homogeneity in human behaviour, such as virus shedding patterns within the population, making it challenging to predict the emergence of new variants due to variant-specific transmission or shedding parameters. This can result in predictions with considerable uncertainty. In this study, we established a state-space model based on wastewater viral load to predict both reported cases and potential infection numbers. Our model using wastewater virus data showed high goodness-of-fit to COVID-19 case numbers despite the dataset including waves of two distinct variants. Furthermore, the model successfully provided estimates of potential infection, reflecting the superspreading nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This study supports the notion that wastewater surveillance and state-space modelling have the potential to effectively predict both reported cases and potential infections.">

        <tr id="Background: Various studies have demonstrated the usefulness of Google search data for public health-monitoring systems. The aim of this study is to be estimated interest of public in infectious diseases in infectious diseases in South Korea, the five other countries. Methods: We conducted cross-country comparisons for queries related to the H1N1 virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We analyzed queries related to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from 20 January to 13 April 2020, and performed time-descriptive and correlation analyses on trend patterns. Results: Trends in H1N1, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 queries in South Korea matched those in the five other countries and worldwide. The relative search volume (RSV) for the MERS-CoV virus increased as the cumulative number of confirmed cases in South Korea increased and decreased significantly as the number of confirmed cases decreased. The volume of COVID-19 queries dramatically increased as South Korea’s confirmed COVID-19 cases grew significantly at the community level. However, RSV remained stable over time. Conclusions: Google Trends provides real-time data based on search patterns related to infectious diseases, allowing for continuous monitoring of public reactions, disease spread, and changes in perceptions or concerns. We can use this information to adjust their strategies of the prevention of epidemics or provide timely updates to the public.">

This study fills a notable literature gap by exploring the following question: Is it possible to incorporate a nonparametric susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) COVID-19 model into the inverse-problem regularization framework when the transmission coefficient varies over time? Our positive response considers varying degrees of disease severity, vaccination, and other time-dependent parameters. In addition, we demonstrate the continuity, differentiability, and injectivity of the operator that link the transmission parameter to the observed infection numbers. By employing Tikhonov-type regularization to the corresponding inverse problem, we establish the existence and stability of regularized solutions.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease primarily transmitted to individuals through direct contact with respiratory droplets. The infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally infecting around 776 million confirmed cases, including over 7 million deaths. Meanwhile, dengue is a vector-borne disease caused by the Flaviviridae virus and is transmitted through bites from female mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. It is estimated that 390 million dengue virus infections occur per year caused by four distinct virus serotypes–DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained public health systems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where dengue is endemic. The overlapping presence of these infectious diseases heightens the risk of co-infection, posing additional diagnostic and treatment challenges. Co-infection of COVID-19 and dengue cases were already reported and confirmed in several countries. In this study, an 11-compartmentalized deterministic mathematical model was developed to understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and dengue co-infection. This modeling approach was described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), examining disease progression over time, offering insights into potential co-infection scenarios andcontrol strategies to help guide public health interventions. The well-posedness of the model was verified, ensuring the existence and uniqueness of its solutions based on continuity, local Lipschitz conditions, and invariance over a compact feasible region. The basic reproduction number (R0), a significant indicator of disease transmission, was calculated using the Next Generation Method (NGM). Four equilibrium points were identified: the disease-free, COVID-19-only, dengue-only, and COVID-19-dengue co-infection equilibrium points. Threshold values of the basic reproduction number were calculated to establish the conditions for the existence and stability of the equilibrium points. These equilibrium points and threshold values provide critical insight into the conditions necessary for eradicating or controlling each disease, serving as a guide for developing interventions during different stages of an epidemic or pandemic. Furthermore, a phase diagram of two parameters sensitive to R0 (COVID-19 transmission βc and dengue vector-to-human transmission Cvh) was established which presented six distinct regions of existence and stability states of the equilibrium points. These regions described different stable epidemiological scenarios whenever the parameter values were varied. Numerical simulations were conducted to verify the stability results and to analyze the effects of varied parameter values on the model solution. The simulations illustrated the positive impacts of reducing the recovery period on the spread of infections even with increasing transmission rates. This demonstrates the effectiveness of timely interventions, such as accelerated recovery through early diagnosis and treatment, in mitigating the severity of outbreaks. All the algebraic calculations, analysis, and numerical simulations were conducted with the aid of MATLAB R2023b and Maple software.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models are vital for understanding real-world phenomena without direct experimentation, particularly in epidemics, as they predict and analyze the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Given the rapid transmission of infectious respiratory diseases, public health measures aim to curb spread while managing impacts. This study assesses rapid contact tracing and testing, focusing on isolating confirmed cases through home-based care or traditional methods, on coronavirus transmission within a community.A deterministic mathematical model using ordinary differential equations segments the population into seven compartments: susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, home-based care, hospitalized, and recovered. The basic reproduction number is determined via the next generation matrix. Local stability of the disease-free equilibrium is analyzed using the trace-determinant method, while global stability is confirmed with the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. A Python-based numerical simulation on NumPy and PyPlot uses parameters calibrated to previous studies and estimated for this research. Simulations indicate home-based care delays peak infection days and reduces peak population, providing time to bolster healthcare facilities. Optimal control methods, including media awareness, reduce susceptibility and encourage asymptomatic individuals to choose home-based care. Using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, the study identifies optimal strategies, highlighting that media awareness effectively lowers susceptibility and optimal control directs asymptomatics to home-based care, reducing strain on healthcare facilities. In conclusion, home-based care is effective for managing mild symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, alleviating pressure on healthcare resources and prioritizing severe cases. Combining home-based care with other non-pharmaceutical strategies is recommended for maximum effectiveness.">

Outbreaks in hospitals can require the closure of bays or entire wards, reducing hospital capacity and having a financial impact upon healthcare providers. Here we evaluate a novel strategy of pre-exposure prophylaxis as a means to reduce the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We model the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) upon levels of ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and ultimately the probability of an infection. We then implement this model within simulations describing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections within a hospital context, simulating an intervention in which UDCA is given to patients on a ward for 10 days following the detection of a case of SARS-CoV-2 on that ward. Under default model parameters we infer a potential 16.5% reduction (95% C. I. 14% - 20%) in the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to patients, with increased importation of cases into the hospital increasing the effectiveness of the intervention. Our study provides preliminary evidence of the value of pre-exposure prophylaxis with UDCA as a strategy to reduce nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 a novel Corona Virus Disease which was caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2) continues to pose a critical and urgent threat to global health. When an infected person comes in contact with a normal individual or when the infected person sneezes or coughs, the virus that triggers COVID-19 spreads.The spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 was increasing, and the threats caused by it were becoming more severe in 2021. To counter the disease and save countless lives in danger, it is necessary to predict the trend of the number of cases and deaths and then implement the policies accordingly. In this paper, the trends of the growth rate of worldwide cases and deaths were studied, and the future growth for 100 days was predicted using the Neural network model and Polynomial Regression model. For efficient planning, the countries were grouped using Principal Component Analysis and the predictions were made. The cases and deaths in different countries and states were related through the Pearson coefficient, and the heat maps were studied. Additionally, in this paper, a case study to predict the trend of cases, number of deaths and recoveries in India was also performed. The Indian states were grouped into four groups based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results, and relevant remarks and trends were suggested. The growth of cases and deaths was studied, and the peaks were predicted for the next 200 days. In recent months, COVID-19 has generated a significant deal of anxiety as a global pandemic, and an increasing number of studies have been published in this area. Consequently, a bibliometric examination of these papers may offer insight into current research hot subjects and trends. We are the first to join stochastic analysis of COVID-19 effects with bibliometric analysis of COVID-19. This prediction, if taken into consideration strategically during the planning of preventive measures of COVID-19 can help to reduce the cases to a great extent.">

        <tr id="Background Since 2019, China has implemented Public Health and Social Measures (PHSMs) to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. As the threat from SARS-CoV-2 diminished, these measures were relaxed, leading to increased respiratory infections and strained health care resources by mid-2023. Methods The study utilised WHO's FluNet and Oxford's COVID-19 Government Response Tracker to assess how policy shifts have affected influenza. It examined changes in influenza incidence, subtype prevalence, and epidemic cycles over three periods: pre-COVID-19 and pre-PHSMs, during COVID-19 and PHSMs, and post-COVID-19 and post-PHSMs. The SEIABR model estimated the transmission probability () and real-time reproduction number () across these periods, while a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) analysed the effects of PHSM indicators on influenza transmission. Results Results indicate that before PHSMs, the average incidence was 4.87 per 100 000, with a β-value of (7.95 ± 1.27) × 10−10 and Rt-value of 1.21 ± 0.16. During PHSMs, incidence dropped to 2.55 per 100 000, and β decreased to (3.17 ± 0.75) × 10−10 (Rt-value of 0.86 ± 0.20). Post-PHSMs, the incidence surged to 17.00 per 100 000, with β rising to 8.36 × 10−10 (Rt-value of 2.25). The GBDT model identified testing policies, public information campaigns, and workplace closures as the most impactful PHSM indicators. Conclusions PHSMs effectively mitigated the spread of influenza, providing a foundation for future policy development to prevent respiratory diseases.">

Although much of the research has focused on predictive models, less attention has been given to analyzing the effectiveness of anti-pandemic measures before the availability of vaccines. This study aims to fill that gap by analyzing the correlation between key COVID-19 endpoints—new confirmed cases and new deaths—across five countries: Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We use a broad range of data sources, including population demographics, geography, health indicators, government responses, mobility patterns, and traffic data, all spanning from March 2020 to April 2021. The dataset covers three waves of the pandemic, with the third wave influenced by the early availability and distribution of vaccines. To identify the most significant factors, a feature selection process was applied to the data, helping to determine the key measures influencing the pandemic’s course. Our findings contribute valuable insights for future pandemics, providing policymakers with evidence-based guidance for implementing the most effective anti-pandemic measures when vaccines are not yet available.">

        <tr id="Background: The requirement for critical care in even a modest fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals made ICU resources an important societal chokepoint during the recent pandemic. We developed a simple regression-based point score in 2020 based on an objective of forecasting critical care occupancy in the Canadian province of Ontario based on mean age of cases, case numbers, and testing volume. Evolution of the pandemic (variants of concern, vaccination) led us to re-assess and re-calibrate our earlier work, with inclusion of information vaccination which became widespread in 2021. Methods: We obtained complete provincial SARS-CoV-2 case, testing, and vaccination data for the period from March 2020 to September 2022, with data subdivided into 6 major waves, following the approach applied by other Canadian investigators. Our initial model was fit only using the first two wild type SARS-CoV-2 waves; an updated model included wave 3 (N501Y+ variants). Our model was validated by comparing model projections to waves not used for model fitting; validation model fits were evaluated with Spearmans rho; counterfactuals without vaccination were modeled to impute fraction of critical care admissions prevented with vaccination. Costing was based on published economic estimates. Results: Our initial model (fit to waves 1 and 2) was well calibrated (rho 0.85) but predictive validity was modest (rho 0.46). Predictive validity improved in models fit to the first 3 pandemic waves without vaccination (rho 0.60) or with vaccination (rho 0.68) (P for inclusion of vaccination 0.013 by Likelihood Ratio Test). Prevented fraction of ICU admissions attributable to vaccination was 144% (22017 admissions expected vs. 9020 observed); based on published estimates of ICU admission cost for SARS-CoV-2 the 12977 admissions averted $2.9 (CDN) billion in economic costs, in contrast to the $3 billion total cost of the vaccination program. Conclusions: Simple time series regression incorporating case and testing characteristics continues to be useful as a tool for forecasting critical care occupancy due to SARS-CoV-2 but early pandemic models need to be updated to capture the preventive effects of widespread vaccination. The economic benefit of vaccination for prevention of critical care resource consumption during the pandemic is substantial, achieving near cost neutrality with the provinces entire vaccination program.">

        <tr id="Infectious disease forecasting has become increasingly important in public health, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, forecasting tools for emergency animal diseases, particularly those offering real-time decision support when parameters governing disease dynamics are unknown, remain limited. We introduce a generalised modelling framework for near-real-time forecasting of the temporal and spatial spread of infectious livestock diseases using data from the early stages of an outbreak. We applied the framework to the 2007 equine influenza outbreak in Australia, generating prediction targets at three timepoints across four regional clusters. Our targets included future daily case counts, outbreak size, peak timing and duration, and spatial distributions of future spread. We evaluated how well the forecasts predicted daily cases and the spatial distribution of case counts, using skill scores as a benchmark for future model improvements. Forecast accuracy, certainty, and skill improved significantly after the outbreak’s peak, while early predictions were more variable, suggesting that pre-peak forecasts should be interpreted with caution. Spatial forecasts maintained positive skill throughout the outbreak, supporting their use in guiding response priorities. This framework provides a tool for real-time decision-making during livestock disease outbreaks and establishes a foundation for future refinements and applications to other animal diseases.">

        <tr id="Covid-19 is the news once again making headlines and announcing its comeback. It has had a profound impact since its December 2019 emergence in
Wuhan, China. The 2019 outbreak was a turning point affecting nearly every country with varying degrees of severity, has led to significant worldwide
mortality and morbidity, causing millions of deaths and long lasting health complications for many. The rapid spread worldwide, led to the World Health
Organization calling it a “global pandemic” on March 11, 2020. Covid-19 is a viral zoonotic disease which spreads from animals-to-humans and humansto-humans. It is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Covid-19 is an enveloped, positive-sense single stranded RNA virus that attaches to the
host cell through its spike protein that facilitates entry into the host cell via the ACE2 receptors. The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets
of an infected person when coughing, sneezing or talking. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals can also spread the disease. Covid-19 has caused
major social, economic, business and lifestyle disruptions. Covid-19 symptoms range from mild to severe and appear between 2-14 days after exposure.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, loss of taste or smell, headache, nausea or vomiting
and diarrhea. In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, ARDS, organ failure and even death. Covid-19 diagnosis is mainly done by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) - the gold standard of testing. Histologically, Covid-19 is responsible for many changes to the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and GI tract.
Symptoms lasting beyond the primary infection (“long-covid”) have shown to have a significant impact on an individual’s daily life. There are several
factors that increase the risk of infection - individuals who are over 60 are at a higher risk versus younger individuals. Individuals with comorbidities, those
who are immunocompromised, those who smoke, use alcohol, lack exercise or are unvaccinated have a higher risk of infection. Infected individuals with
underlying health conditions can experience a host of complications such as mild to severe organ impairment (heart, liver, kidney, brain), diabetes, dementia,
neurological, GI, hematological or muscular pain. The risk also increases for individuals who are lower on the socio-economic spectrum. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of vaccines, masks, social distancing, hygiene protocols, quarantine and isolation to reduce
the transmission risk, prevent hospitalization, severe illness or death. The advent of highly efficacious vaccines using novel mRNA technology has seen the
effects of the disease wane. Covid-19 infection rates are slowing and the pandemic is giving way to an endemic. However, one question remains - how well
prepared are we for the next major outbreak?.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
School closures have been a prominent component of the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response. However, their effect on viral transmission, COVID-19 mortality and health care system pressure remains incompletely understood, as traditional observational studies fall short in assessing such population-level impacts.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
We used a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 epidemics of 74 countries, incorporating observed data from 2020 to 2022 and historical school closure timelines. We then simulated a counterfactual scenario, assuming that schools remained open throughout the study period. We compared the simulated epidemics in terms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, deaths, and hospital occupancy pressure. We estimated that school closures achieved moderate to significant burden reductions in most settings over the period 2020 to 2022. They reduced peak hospital occupancy pressure in nearly all countries, with 72 out of 74 countries (97%) showing a positive median estimated effect, and median estimated effect ranging from reducing peak hospital occupancy pressure by 89% in Brazil to increasing it by 19% in Indonesia. The median estimated effect of school closures on COVID-19 deaths ranged from a 73% reduction in Thailand to a 7% increase in the United Kingdom. We estimated that school closures may have increased overall COVID-19 mortality (based on median estimates) in 9 countries (12%), including several European nations and Indonesia. This is attributed to changes in population-level immunity dynamics, leading to a concentration of the epidemic during the Delta variant period, alongside an upward shift in the age distribution of infections. While our estimates were associated with significant uncertainty, our sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of social mixing assumptions revealed robustness in our country-specific conclusions. The main study limitations include the fact that analyses were conducted at the national level, whereas school closure policies often varied by region. Furthermore, some regions, including Africa, were underrepresented due to insufficient data informing the model.


CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis revealed nuanced effects of school closures on COVID-19 dynamics, with reductions in COVID-19 impacts in most countries but negative epidemiological effects in a few others. We identified critical mechanisms for consideration in future policy decisions, highlighting the unpredictable nature of emerging variants and potential shifts in infection demographics associated with school closures.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption and prompted the implementation of nonpharmaceutical measures in several countries to contain the spread of the disease until a vaccine became available. Urban mobility reduction has historically been employed to limit the transmission of epidemics. However, only some studies have quantified the effectiveness of such restrictions across different sectors of society. To address this gap, we have adapted an agent-based model that utilizes data from the Google Community Mobility Report to simulate the dynamics of COVID-19 across 14 Brazilian capitals. Each agent in the model has a network of contacts established from mobility data across various categories. We simulated six scenarios for each capital, each with different probabilities of contagion in each category. Our findings show that different scenarios are more effective in describing the curve of infected people and deaths in each city. In particular, our results indicate that the same scenario was optimal for describing the number of cases and deaths in Belo Horizonte. However, the first peak in the number of deaths could not be reproduced in the model, possibly due to issues with the data recording. Our proposed model can be further developed to incorporate additional elements related to the dynamics of an epidemic and can serve as an additional tool in understanding and planning actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 beyond mobility, particularly in urban centers.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RT–PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and key COVID-19 transmission and outcome metrics across five years of the pandemic in Jalisco, Mexico. Utilizing a comprehensive time-series analysis, we evaluated weekly median Ct values as proxies for viral load and their temporal associations with positivity rates, reproduction numbers (Rt), hospitalizations, and mortality. Cross-correlation and lagged regression analyses revealed significant lead–lag relationships, with declining Ct values consistently preceding surges in positivity rates and hospitalizations, particularly during the early phases of the pandemic. Granger causality tests and vector autoregressive modeling confirmed the predictive utility of Ct values, highlighting their potential as early warning indicators. The study further observed a weakening association in later pandemic stages, likely influenced by the emergence of new variants, hybrid immunity, changes in human behavior, and diagnostic shifts. These findings underscore the value of Ct values as scalable tools for public health surveillance and highlight the importance of contextualizing their analysis within specific epidemiological and temporal frameworks. Integrating Ct monitoring into surveillance systems could enhance pandemic preparedness, improve outbreak forecasting, and strengthen epidemiological modeling.">

The next generation matrix is employed to compute the basic reproduction numbers ($R_0$). We also analyzed the sensitivity of parameters concerning $R_0$. If $R_0 < 1$, then the disease-free equilibrium point exists and is locally stable, whereas the endemic equilibrium point exists when $R_0 > 1$ and is locally stable if the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is satisfied.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mathematical models of viral dynamics are crucial in understanding infection trajectories. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) viral load data often includes limited sparse observations with significant heterogeneity. This study aims to: (1) understand the impact of patient characteristics in shaping the temporal viral load trajectory and (2) establish a data collection protocol (DCP) to reliably reconstruct individual viral load trajectories. We collected longitudinal viral load data for SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta and Omicron variants from 243 patients in Singapore (2021–2022). A viral dynamics model was calibrated using patients' age, symptom presence, and vaccination status. We accessed associations between these patient characteristics and aspects of viral dynamics using linear regression models. We evaluated the accuracy of viral load trajectory estimation under different simulated DCPs by varying patient numbers, test frequencies, and test intervals. Older unvaccinated individuals had a longer viral shedding duration due to lower infection and cell death rates. Higher peak viral loads were found in older, symptomatic, and vaccinated individuals, with earlier peaks in younger vaccinated individuals. Symptom presence and vaccination resulted in a shorter time from infection to diagnosis. To accurately estimate viral dynamics, more frequent tests, longer test intervals, and larger patient samples are required. For 500 patients, a 21‐day follow‐up with measurements every 3 days and an 8‐day follow‐up with daily measurements was optimal for the Delta and Omicron variants, respectively. Patient characteristics significantly impacted viral dynamics. Our analytic approach and recommended DCPs can enhance preparedness and response to emerging pathogens beyond SARS‐CoV‐2.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely transmissible disease that causes tremendous human suffering worldwide, with millions of people dying within two years. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 pandemic continues with an increasing number of positive cases. In order to monitor and prevent the disease, disease mapping is proposed for quantifying and describing the disease risk. The primary objective of this research is to estimate the COVID-19 relative risk using one of the most widely employed Bayesian approaches, namely the Poisson-gamma model, and eventually display a disease map to show the COVID-19 risk level in each state. The relative risk results are divided into five different levels to classify the COVID-19 risk level in each Malaysian state. The illustration of five different shades in the disease mapping has distinguished the risk levels within each state, where the most light-coloured area indicates very low risk whilst the most dark-coloured area indicates very high risk. According to the results, the area with the lowest risk of contracting COVID-19 in 2020 is Perlis, and the area with the highest risk is Labuan, whereas in 2021, Perlis remains the lowest risk area while Selangor is the highest risk area.">

        <tr id="A novel time-dependent deterministic SEIRS model, extended with vaccination, hospitalization, and vital dynamics, is introduced. Time-varying basic and effective reproduction numbers associated with this model are defined, which are crucial metrics in understanding epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, a parameter identification approach has been used to develop a numerical method to compute these numbers for long-term epidemics. We analyze the actual COVID-19 data from the USA, Italy, and Bulgaria to solve appropriate inverse problems and gain an understanding of the time evolution behavior of the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Moreover, an insightful comparison of key coronavirus data and epidemiological parameters across these countries has been conducted. For this purpose, while the basic and effective reproduction numbers provide insights into the virus transmission potential, we propose data-driven criteria for assessing the actual realization of the transmission potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the effectiveness of the applied restrictive measures. To obtain these results, we conduct a mathematical analysis to demonstrate various biological properties of the new differential model, including non-negativity, boundedness, existence, and uniqueness of the solution. The new model and the associated numerical simulation tools proposed herein could be applied to COVID-19 data in any country worldwide and hold a promising potential for the transmission capacity and impact of the virus.">

        <tr id="By considering the recently introduced SIRU model, in this paper we study the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic under the temporally varying public intervention in the Chilean context. More precisely, we propose a method to forecast cumulative daily reported cases CR(t), and a systematic way to identify the unreported daily cases given CR(t) data. We firstly base on the recently introduced epidemic model SIRU (Susceptible, Asymptomatic Infected, Reported infected, Unreported infected), and focus on the transmission rate parameter τ. To understand the dynamic of the data, we extend the scalar τ to an unknown function τ(t) in the SIRU system, which is then inferred directly from the historical CR(t) data, based on nonparametric estimation. The estimation of τ(t) leads to the estimation of other unobserved functions in the system, including the daily unreported cases. Furthermore, the estimation of τ(t) allows us to build links between the pandemic evolution and the public intervention, which is modeled by logistic regression. We then employ polynomial approximation to construct a predicted curve which evolves with the latest trend of CR(t). In addition, we regularize the evolution of the forecast in such a way that it corresponds to the future intervention plan based on the previously obtained link knowledge. We test the proposed predictor on different time windows. The promising results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, has profoundly impacted global public health, economies, and healthcare systems since its emergence in late 2019. This research paper examines the global response to the pandemic, focusing on healthcare infrastructure, public health strategies, vaccination campaigns, and digital health innovations. By analysing data from countries severely affected by the pandemic, such as Italy, the United States, India, and Brazil, this study explores the correlation between healthcare capacity, ICU utilization, and mortality rates. Additionally, it evaluates the effectiveness of early interventions, including lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates, in controlling the virus’s spread and reducing healthcare strain. The analysis reveals that countries with robust healthcare systems and early implementation of public health measures were more successful in managing COVID-19 outbreaks and minimizing deaths. Vaccination played a critical role in mitigating the pandemic’s severity, with countries achieving higher vaccination coverage witnessing significant reductions in hospitalizations and fatalities. The study also highlights the essential role of digital health solutions, such as contact tracing apps and telemedicine, in maintaining healthcare services while curbing the virus's spread. This paper concludes with lessons learned from the pandemic, emphasizing the need for greater global cooperation, investment in healthcare infrastructure, and equitable access to vaccines and medical supplies. These findings aim to guide future pandemic preparedness strategies, ensuring that the world is better equipped to handle similar health crises.">

As a result of this, many researchers are opting for digital data collection methods rather than manual way of collection. Data collection via phone, emails, and various other digital platforms were being preferred. This study will help to understand that how covid infection affects the various human body systems including the age, occupation, gender, blood groups and co-morbidities.

        <tr id="Abstract Background In a field where few reports have been made on the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in healthcare settings. We experienced an outbreak of an alpha variant in a medical institution cluster after healthcare workers were vaccinated, providing a novel perspective on the topic.Figure 1. Epidemic curve based on the day of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (A) or on the symptom onset day (B) during this COVID-19 outbreak The index case was a patient admitted to the hospital on 24 May. The last positive case was detected ten days after the first detection, but 42 patients, including five asymptomatics and three healthcare workers, including an asymptomatic, were infected. Methods We conducted descriptive epidemiology from case detection in the cluster of medical institutions with the alpha variant in June 2021. We also compared the relationship between vaccination status and infection using the Fisher exact test for healthcare workers in the same period.Figure 2. Diagram of hospital room layouts for patients infected in the first wave (through June 1) We confirmed infected inpatients in a wide range of hospital rooms. Results We identified one healthcare worker as a first test-positive case on 4 Jun 2021, and 21 positive patients were identified by screening on the day of detection and the following day. Based on the descriptive epidemiological analysis, the index case was a patient admitted to the hospital on 24 May with pneumonia treated with NPPV in an independently air-conditioned negative pressure room from the third day of admission. The last positive case was detected 10 days after first detection, but 42 patients and three healthcare workers were infected (Figure 1). Forty-two of 88 hospitalized patients (53.7%) and 3 of 38 healthcare workers (7.9%) were infected. There were no cases of infection among the 30 healthcare workers who had completed the 2-dose vaccination, and the infection rate was significantly lower than that of the staff members who had not completed the vaccination (0% (0/30) vs. 37.5% (3/8), p=0.008). No hospitalized patients had completed the 2-dose vaccination, including infected and uninfected cases. Aerosol transmission from initial cases, the patient-to-patient droplet route, and the hospital ward contact route were considered factors in the spread of the disease (Figure 2 and Figure 3).Figure 3. Links within the cluster Aerosol transmission from initial cases, the patient-to-patient droplet route, and the hospital ward contact route were considered factors in the spread of the disease. Conclusion Our study not only underscores the importance of strict adherence to standard precautions, early detection of infected cases, and implementation of route-specific prophylaxis but also highlights the crucial role of vaccination in preventing the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 clusters in medical institutions.

        <tr id="Objectives Early in the outbreak, to predict the final size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Dalian, Liaoning province, China, the finding can be used to provide a scientific reference for timely adjustment of prevention and control strategies. Methods Data from COVID-19 patients were collected from August 26 to September 14 2022. Early in the outbreak, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantine-Recovered (SEIQR) dynamics model with an epidemic amplifier effect, based on the basic model, was developed to fit the data and predict the final size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Dalian, Liaoning province, China. The mean absolute relative error(MARE), root mean squared error(RMSE) and mean absolute error(MAE) were used to assess the predictive capacity of the model. Results From 26 August to 14 September 2022, 1132 confirmed cases and infected asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 (558 males and 574 females) were reported in Dalian. There were two epidemic amplifiers in this outbreak, namely, T Market and H Hotel. The outbreak size predicted by the combined application of the SEIQR model with these two amplifiers is 1168.34 cases, and MARE, RMSE and MAE compared to the actual value from September 1 to 14 is 1.894%, 21.473 and 17.492 respectively According to the fitting results of the basic SEIQR model, if there was no epidemic amplifier in this outbreak, the final outbreak size was 349.96 cases, which means that the T Market and H Hotel increased 822 infections through amplification. Conclusions Early in the outbreak, it was effective and reliable to use the SEIQR transmission dynamics model with the amplifier effect to predict the final size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Dalian, Liaoning province, China, and the result can provide a theoretical basis for the early closing of the COVID-19 epidemic amplifier sites. Furthermore, the epidemic amplifier effect added to the model can solve the homogeneous mixing hypothesis problem that does not match the actual spread of infectious diseases but commonly used by researchers in the construction process of the dynamic model.">

        <tr id="During the COVID-19 pandemic, case isolation emerged as a key non-pharmaceutical intervention in pandemic response. Its effectiveness hinges on the timing of isolation, which is often dictated by the onset of contagiousness. While minimizing isolation delays is crucial, the impact of evolving epidemic dynamics, such as changes in viral load distributions among cases, is less understood. These dynamics could inform more efficient isolation strategies. We developed a multi-scale agent-based model to assess isolation policies that consider viral loads. Our model compares the outcomes of universal isolation with strategies that exempt low viral load cases post-peak. We found that most low viral load cases identified after the peak are less contagious, raising the question of their need for isolation. Our analysis reveals that exempting these individuals slightly increases new infections and, unexpectedly, reduces efficiency, defined as infections averted per isolation. These results advise caution with adaptive isolation policies. Our flexible model can evaluate complex strategies, aiding future public health planning.">

        <tr id="Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus within a host poses a unique challenge in understanding immunological dynamics, especially the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in mediating the immune response. This work present a mathematical model to examine the dynamics of coinfection within a host, highlighting CTL-mediated immunity. Generally, this model encompasses several compartments, including epithelial cells, free viruses, and CTLs specific of both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A. The basic properties of the model, equilibrum state analysis, stability using the Lyapunov function, and numerical simulations are examined to investigate the dynamics behavior of the model. Eight equilibrium states are identified: the virus-free equilibrium (E0), single SARS-CoV-2 infection without CTLs (E1), single Influenza A virus infection without CTLs (E2), single SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs (E3), single Influenza A virus infection with Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E4), SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs (E5), SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E6), and SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with both SARS-CoV-2-specific and Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E7). The existence and stability regions for each equilibrium state are determined and represented in the R1-R2 plane as threshold functions within the model. Numerical simulations confirm the results of the qualitative analysis, demonstrating that CTLs specific to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus can be activated, reducing the number of infected epithelial cells as well as inhibiting virus transmission within epithelial cells. Furthermore, analysis of parameter changes shows that increasing the proliferation rate of epithelial cells and CTLs, while lowering the virus formation rate, can shift the system's stability threshold and stabilize it at the virus-free equilibrium.">

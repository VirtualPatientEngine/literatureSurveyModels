        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common rheumatological disease. In addition to joint pathology, it often causes damage of other organs and tissues. This article discusses the possibility of diffuse damage of the peripheral nervous system in rheumatoid arthritis - frequency, mechanisms of damage, peculiarities of the clinical symptoms. The relevance of this problem is due to the possibility of subclinical course of polyneuropathy in rheumatoid arthritis, and, consequently, the lack of diagnosis, while one of its variants - autonomic neuropathy, is a life-threatening pathology. In the presence of pain in the clinical picture of polyneuropathy, problems arise in its interpretation (neuropathic, nociceptive - joint pain), and, therefore, errors in dose adjustment of disease-modifying drugs are possible. For neurologists the problem of polyneuropathy in rheumatoid arthritis is interesting from the point of view of diagnosing the etiology of this disease, which is always a difficult task.">

        <tr id="Swelling, stiffness, and pain in synovial joints are primary hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperactivity of nociceptors and excessive release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators play a crucial role, with emerging data suggesting extensive remodelling and plasticity of joint innervations. Herein, we review structural, functional, and molecular alterations in sensory and autonomic axons wiring arthritic joints and revisit mechanisms implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors, leading to chronic pain. Sprouting and reorganization of sensory and autonomic fibers with the invasion of ectopic branches into surrounding inflamed tissues are associated with the upregulation of pain markers. These changes are frequently complemented by a phenotypic switch of sensory and autonomic profiles and activation of silent axons, inferring homeostatic adjustments and reprogramming of innervations. Identifying critical molecular players and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the rewiring and sensitization of joints is likely to elucidate causatives of neuroinflammation and chronic pain, assisting in finding new therapeutic targets and opportunities for interventions.">

        <tr id="Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an auto immune disease leads to
progressive destruction of synovial membrane of joints, causing pain, deformity
and functional limitation, which results in severe disability in performing daily
and professional activities. The burden of rheumatoid arthritis RA in general
population varies high in females. The most common cause of rheumatoid
arthritis in individual life is activities limitations. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease
that should be examined and assessed carefully in the general peoples as well as
in patients , because if this disease is identified later can lead to a state of
irreversible damage of the articular cartilage of the joints , which can lead further
disability and increases activities limitation .
Objective: to asses activities limitation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
Methodology: Total of 132 patients in the study. Data was collected at
rheumatology OPD at arif diagnostic hospital and research center Hayatabad
Peshawar. Data from patients were collected through health assessment
questionnaire (HAQ) convenient sampling technique was used, data was analyzed
using SPSS version 26.
Result: total of 132 participated, ranging in age from 25-60 years, mean age was
47.6±10.3. Female patients were more than male patients. Out of 132 patients 2
67.4% have female patients and 32.6% were have male patients with rheumatoid
arthritis
Conclusion: most of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis were having activities
limitations in their daily life. in term of severity most patients were have moderate
pain .

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune joint disease. Its main pathological manifestations are joint cartilage, bone tissue injury, synovial hyperplasia, and chronic inflammation. At present, the pathogenesis of the disease has not been fully defined, and delaying the disease to improve joint function is the existing treatment. Sinomenium (SIN) is an effective ingredient in Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils., with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, immunosuppressive, anti-tumor, and other pharmacological activities, which is quite effective in the treatment of RA. There are many SIN compound preparations in the market, such as Zhengqing Fengtongning capsule, Zhubi Huoluo prescription, and Qinxitong tablet. They all exhibit good anti-RA effect with less adverse reactions. This study summarized the mechanism of action of SIN in the treatment of RA and further explored the possibility of SIN in the treatment of RA combined with other diseases for future research.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an important autoimmune disease that affects synovial tissues, accompanied by redness, pain, and swelling as main symptoms, which will limit the quality of daily life and even cause disability. Multiple coupling effects among the various cells in the synovial micro-environment modulate the poor progression and development of diseases. Respectively, synovium is the primary target tissue of inflammatory articular pathologies; synovial hyperplasia, and excessive accumulation of immune cells lead to joint remodelling and destroyed function. In general, epigenetic modification is an effective strategy to regulate dynamic balance of synovial homeostasis. Several typical post-transcriptional changes in cellular RNA can control the post-transcriptional modification of RNA structure. It can inhibit important processes, including degradation of RNA and nuclear translocation. Recent studies have found that RNA modification regulates the homeostasis of the synovial micro-environment and forms an intricate network in the “bone-cartilage-synovium” feedback loop. Aberrant regulation of RNA methylation triggers the pathological development of RA. Collectively, this review summarises recent advanced research about RNA modification in modulating synovial homeostasis by making close interaction among resident synovial macrophages, fibroblasts, T cells, and B cells, which could display the dramatic role of RNA modifications in RA pathophysiological process and perform the promising therapeutic target for treating RA.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that can be accompanied by complex liver involvement. The diagnosis and differentiation of these conditions are often complicated by the rarity of liver biopsies and the similarity of symptoms to other liver diseases. Viral hepatitis B and C in the context of rheumatoid arthritis can mimic rheumatological manifestations, further complicating timely diagnosis and worsening the prognosis for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
This literature review aims to systematize knowledge and assess the risks associated with the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with viral hepatitis B and C. Additionally, the article aims to provide recommendations for screening and treatment of viral hepatitis in these patients.
The review is based on the analysis of available literature for the last ten years, including clinical trials, meta‑analyses, systematic reviews, and recommendations for the treatment of viral hepatitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. According to the literature, liver involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be caused by the disease itself, its treatment, or viral infections. Research results emphasize the importance of regular monitoring of liver function and screening for viral hepatitis B and C before starting rheumatoid arthritis treatment and during the use of immunosuppressive drugs.
The integration of screening for viral hepatitis B and C into standard medical protocols for patients with rheumatoid arthritis before starting immunosuppressive therapy is essential. The timely detection of these infections is crucial because the treatment of hepatitis and immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis are interconnected and require a comprehensive approach. Adaptation of treatment depending on the status of viral infection is necessary to minimize liver risks and optimize the outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of autoimmune disease with a complex pathogenesis, involving immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Current treatment for RA mainly focuses on alleviating inflammation, and the disease is still hard to be cured completely. Rheumatoid arthritis microenvironment (RAM) makes treatment even more difficult, with synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis and bone destruction causing RA uncontrollable. Continuous chronic inflammation and retention effect (EPR) of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) in RAM lead to a vicious circle, resulting in difficulty in treatment. In joints of RA, macrophages, especially activated M1 macrophages, produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6, to maintain and exacerbate joint inflammation. Therefore, M1 macrophages has become an important target to treat RA. This study aims to develop a new treatment strategy by using targeted silver nanoparticles loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and modified folic acid (FA) to achieve M1macrophage targeting. According to previous research articles, modified silver nanoparticles have benign in vitro targeting and treating effects on M1 macrophages, providing a new idea and possibility for RA treatment.">

        <tr id="Septic arthritis is acute onset of monoarticular inflammation of a joint due to an infectious etiology. It is usually bacterial but can be viral or fungal. Septic arthritis causes significant morbidity and mortality and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Risk factors include age older than 80 years, smoking, comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, skin infection, HIV infection, osteoarthritis), and other factors (eg, recent joint surgery, joint prosthesis, previous intra-articular injection). The clinical presentation of septic arthritis can overlap with those of many other joint conditions, which can make diagnosis challenging. Poor functional outcomes, such as amputation, arthrodesis, prosthetic surgery, and severe functional deterioration, occur in approximately 24% to 33% of patients with septic arthritis. Due to the significant sequelae associated with septic arthritis, it is critical for physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for this condition. Management involves a combination of medical and surgical treatments tailored to infection severity, causative pathogens, and overall patient condition. Medical treatment is not inferior to surgical treatment. However, 30% of patients with septic arthritis ultimately require surgical treatment. The 90-day mortality rate of knee septic arthritis is 7% in patients 79 years and younger and from 22% to 69% in patients older than 79 years.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease, progressively distinctive via cartilage destruction, auto-antibody production, severe joint pain, and synovial inflammation. Nanotechnology represents one of the utmost promising scientific technologies of the 21st century. Nanocarriers could be the key to unlocking its potential by encapsulating Rutin in targeted drug delivery systems, potentially for targeted Rheumatoid arthritis therapy.


OBJECTIVE
The rationale of current research is to prepare liposomes loaded with a bioflavonoid drug rutin for effective management of rheumatoid arthritis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study investigated the formulation of rutin liposomes using the thinfilm hydration technique, also known as the Bangham method. A Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize the formulation parameters. The LP2 batch was then characterized for its mean particle size, zeta potential, shape, diffraction pattern, and thermal properties. Finally, the in-vitro anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the rutin liposomes were evaluated using appropriate assays.


RESULTS
Out of thirteen batches, LP2 was found to be an optimized batch with a mean particle size of 167.1 nm, zeta potential -13.50 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 61.22%. The above results showed higher stability of rutin liposomes. Further characterization of LP2 for morphological assessment, XRD analysis, and DSC revealed its spherical shape less than 1 μm, polycrystalline nature, and thermographic peak at 139°C, respectively. Evaluation of the antioxidant properties and antiinflammatory potential of LP2 revealed its maximum therapeutic potential in the reduction of inflammation and protein denaturation when evaluated via in-vitro assays.


CONCLUSION
Rutin liposomal formulation has tremendous potential for the management of Rheumatoid arthritis due to its enhanced bioavailability, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties when compared to free rutin.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis is a commonly encountered autoimmune disease and a progressive chronic inflammatory condition that often leads to permanent joint damage. Systemic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis is linked to various comorbid conditions such as interstitial lung disease, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, infections, malignancies, cognitive dysfunction, depression, and fatigue, which can increase morbidity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Approximately 36% of patients report worse health and limitations in daily activities, while nearly 30% require more assistance with personal care compared to individuals without rheumatoid arthritis. Epidemiological data from 1990 to 2017 show an incidence of rheumatoid arthritis of 246.6 per 100,000 people aged 33-54 years, with prevalence in women 2-3 times higher. In Southeast Asia, the incidence is 89 per 100,000 in individuals aged 13-22 years, while in Indonesia, it is estimated at around 5-7.5 per 100,000 population. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients, with myocardial infarction being the major contributor. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is still complex and involves immunological processes that occur long before joint inflammation symptoms appear, including genetic modifications and environmental factors that lead to deimination and joint disturbances. Cardiovascular manifestations, particularly myocardial infarction, occur due to an atherosclerotic process triggered by rheumatoid antibody complexes. Given the higher cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients, early detection and awareness of these manifestations are crucial for better management.">

        <tr id="Key principles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management include early patient evaluation by a rheumatologist and early initiation of pharmacologic therapy in patients at risk for chronic disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy. Integrative medicine therapies with limited evidence include acupuncture, mind-body therapies (eg, yoga, tai chi), and dietary supplements.">

        <tr id="Introduction Pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an unmet clinical need. Targeting joint inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not resulted in the anticipated reduction in pain for many patients. This can partly be explained by the concept of central sensitisation whereby spinal and supraspinal pathways have a lower threshold of activation leading to increased perception of pain. Synovial stromal cells such as fibroblasts are also thought to play a role through peripheral sensitisation of nerves in the joint. Synovial fibroblasts are known to produce pro-algesic mediators such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nerve growth factor (NGF) at the mRNA level. These pro-algesic mediators could activate sensory nerve fibres that send signals from the joint to the spinal cord, thereby driving persistent pain in RA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate which pro-algesic mediators are produced by lining versus sublining fibroblasts and whether the level of these mediators correlates with clinical measures of pain in patients with RA. Methods and analysis FiND-Pain RA is a multi-centre observational study which will recruit 50 patients with seropositive RA who attend the rheumatology department of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Clinical examination, pain-focused patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), ultrasound examination and ultrasound guided synovial biopsy of the knee will be performed. The levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators will be measured in fibroblasts from the lining and sublining layer of the synovium. The location and spatial morphology of sensory nerve fibres and their proximity to lining and sub-lining fibroblasts will be characterized. The primary outcome will be to determine whether the knee pain scores of participants correlate with the level of LIF, a novel putative pain-mediator expressed in sub-lining fibroblasts. The secondary outcomes will be to determine whether other pro-algesic mediators produced by lining or sub-lining fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures of pain and to assess the location and proximity of sensory nerve fibres to lining versus sub-lining fibroblasts.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation in the joints, leading to pain, swelling, stiffness, and eventual joint damage. This condition occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the synovium, the lining of the membranes surrounding the joints. Treatment focuses on reducing inflammation, alleviating pain, and preventing joint damage through a combination of medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Recently, biological therapies have been introduced, including Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) blockers (such as etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab), IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab), and interleukin- 1 inhibitors (anakinra). These treatments can lead to various side effects. The use of herbalbased treatments, such as secondary metabolites, has gained popularity due to their better tolerability, safety, and effectiveness compared to conventional therapies. However, there are also some limitations, like poor bioavailability and permeability and lower stability; to overcome these issues, Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS) have been introduced as better treatment options in recent years. Polymer science advancements and nanotechnology applications have opened new avenues for RA treatment, emphasizing the development of smart drug delivery systems. These systems aim to improve therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects. Additionally, newly synthesized biocompatible drug delivery systems, combined with anti-inflammatory drugs composed of secondary metabolites, offer potential solutions for RA.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a phenotypically diverse disease. 
AIM: To analyze the role of some triggers of rheumatoid arthritis and joint symptoms in individuals at risk of the disease at preclinical stages and their link with clinical and laboratory indices. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In groups of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (n=461), their relatives (n=247) and 299 healthy individuals, information on a possible trigger was analyzed, namely, past infections,, anxiety level, number of childbirths, age of menopause onset, body mass index. The impact of these triggers on clinical and laboratory indices, namely with complex activity indices, morning stiffness duration, joint functional disability using Health Assessment Questionnaire, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of C-reactive protein, antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides, rheumatoid factor was analyzed, using Mann–Whitney, Spearman Rank Order Correlation, Multiple regression analysis. 
RESULTS: The most frequently identified triggers for the development of the disease and preclinical joint symptoms were the onset of menopause (17.6% and 11.7%), infections (13.4%, 15.8%), and mental stress (15.2%, 18.2%). Preclinical joint symptoms were also provoked by intense physical activity (19.8%). When the disease was provoked by an infection or the onset of menopause, an increase in the number/duration of infections (p=0.000) and body mass index (p=0.019 and p=0.024) was found compared to the control. When preclinical joint symptoms were provoked by infections or physical activity, the number/duration of annual infections exceeded those in the control (p=0,000, p=0,000 respectively). When preclinical joint symptoms was were provoked by infection (p=0.010) or by menopause onset (p=0.033), or physical activity (p=0.020), a higher Westergren's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value was observed than that in the cases provoked by mental stress. The arthralgia score was highest in cases developed with onset of menopause compared to cases provoked by infections (p=0.053), childbirth (p=0.012). When preclinical joint symptoms were provoked by mental stress, this indicator was higher than that in cases provoked by physical exertion (p=0.002). In the preclinical group, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values depended on the body mass index (p=0.005 and p=0.028). In early rheumatoid arthritis with a high level of personal anxiety, the concentrations of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (p=0.044) and rheumatoid factor (p=0.009) were lower than that in the cases with an intermediate level of personal anxiety. 
CONCLUSION: Thus, the triggers studied have imprinted on the phenotypes of rheumatoid arthritis and preclinical joint symptoms.">

        <tr id="Objective: This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctions between two enduring autoimmune disorders: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Ankyliosing spondylitis (AS), both of which affect the musculoskeletal system. The article highlights the differences in clinical manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and treatment approaches for these conditions. Methodology: This study is conducted by reviewing on google scholar using keywords such as RA and AS. Discussion: The article emphasizes that the key differences between these conditions lie in the affected body areas, genetic predisposition, and joint involvement. While RA mainly affects peripheral joints with inflammation of synovial tissues, AS primarily impacts the axial skeleton, leading to the fusion of spinal structures. RA has a strong autoimmune component, whereas AS is linked to HLA-B27. Treatment strategies differ, with RA benefiting from DMARDs and biologics, while AS relies on NSAIDs and TNF inhibitors. Understanding these distinctions is vital for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning. A patient’s quality of life may be significantly impacted by either of disease, underscoring the importance of early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach. Tailoring management to individual patient needs, considering factors like disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, is essential. Regular monitoring, physical therapy, and lifestyle adjustments play crucial roles in managing these chronic conditions.">

 Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disease, affecting the joints and other organs. Several treatments have been approved for use in its management including biologics. Golimumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of TNF-alpha to its receptor, has been considered a treatment since 2013. The efficacy and safety of golimumab was reported in some studies designed as open-label trials and a few randomized controlled trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.



 To assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous golimumab in a sample of Syrian patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis that was un-responded to different disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.



 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the rheumatology departments were enrolled in our study. The patients were divided into two groups: 50 patients who were given subcutaneous golimumab, as a patient group, and 50 patients who were receiving conventional antirheumatic modifiers, as a control group. Side effects of golimumab and the other treatments were registered.



 We found that golimumab is effective in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as it achieved a significant response rate during the follow-up period, as assessed by the DAS28-ESR score. The mean DAS28-ESR at the start was 5.33 ± 0.85), and with follow-up of the patients during the study period, it decreased significantly to 3.81 after 3 months and then to 2.03 after a year. Patients achieved a significant response of 94% within the first 3 months of golimumab administration according to EULAR response criteria. The rate of remission of the disease after 1 year was 90%. There was only one side effect, which was an upper respiratory infection, in two patients (4%) after 3 months, and in only one patient (2%) after 6 months.

        <tr id="Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic autoimmune condition characterized by joint inflammation and pain, leading to the degeneration of the joints and bones, which may develop into deformities. The identification of the potential of new RA biomarkers, such as IL-37 isoforms for diagnosis and treatment applications is now under investigation. Purpose: This research aims to investigate the connection between the expression of IL37 isoform-c and IL37 isoform-d genes with RA activity and severity, their rules in diagnosis of the disease and for future RA therapeutic purposes. Methods: A case-control study was conducted on a total of 140 individuals. A total of 70 patients, who were recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis by a rheumatologist, were included in the study, along with 70 control volunteers. The samples were obtained by using freshly acquired blood and serum samples via the use of RT-qPCR, ELISA, and other methods. The sample included 64 females and 6 men in both the patient and control groups. The age ranges from 20 to 70 years. Specimens were gathered between August 2023 and December 2023 from the Rheumatology department at AL-Sader Medical City in Najaf Governorate, Iraq. The blood IL-37 level was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, immune markers including Anti-CCP, ESR, RF, and CRP were assessed. The quantification of IL-37 isoforms' gene expression was performed using qRT-PCR. The activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was assessed using DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, and CDAI, which also allowed for the determination of disease severity. Results: The levels of inflammatory parameters including Anti-CCP, CRP, RF, and ESR were significantly elevated in RA patients in compared to controls. IL-37 isoform-c mRNA expression, as determined by RT-qPCR, has significantly greater expression in the patients' group. It was upregulated in moderate groups of patients. Furthermore, the isoform-d gene was downregulated, in contrast to control groups for both genes, who exhibited normal expression for these genes. And there was a non-significant association between IL37 isoforms c and d expression and RA activity and severity. However, IL37-c expression increased within the moderate patient groups based on severity and activity categorization as compared to controls.    Conclusion: IL37 isoform-c and isoform-d are considered as a weak biomarker for diagnosing RA, evaluating disease activity and severity for RA patients.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial incurable immune-inflammatory disease. Progression leads to joint deformation, cartilage and bone tissue destruction, and subsequent disability. The primary goal of RA pharmacotherapy is to achieve disease remission. For this purpose, several classes of drugs are used: basic anti-inflammatory drugs (DMARDs), which are a large group of synthetic and biological drugs that are combined according to their ability to influence the pathogenetic mechanisms of RA; glucocorticoids, which are recommended for use in combination with DMARDs; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are used to relieve acute and chronic pain. The treatment of RA is a long-term process, and the drugs used for this condition are not always safe and not always effective, which leads to discontinuation of treatment in 20–50 % of patients. Therefore, there is a need to develop new pharmacological targets that can increase drug effectiveness and reduce drug toxicity. One promising therapeutic target is proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), particularly PAR2, whose activation contributes to the occurrence of inflammation, fibrosis, and proliferation of connective tissue. Experiments have demonstrated that inhibition of PAR2 activity prevents the development of RA pathogenesis and positively modifies the course of the disease. The search for drugs that inhibit PAR2 was carried out in the following directions: indirect blockade of PAR2 activity; creation of monoclonal antibodies; search for PAR2 inhibitors among peptide compounds; synthesis of low-molecular-weight inhibitory substances.">

        <tr id="Introduction and aim of the study: The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in our society is relatively high. As a result, the number of people requiring some kind of treatment or improvement in quality of life is also increasing day by day. In our study, we aimed to explore the topic of reducing discomfort associated with this condition. We decided to examine the effects of physical activity on individual complaints and systemic symptoms. We summarised the influence of different exercises on pain, fatigue, inflammation, and the cardiovascular system. 
Materials and methods: The authors conducted an extensive review of articles available in PubMed, Google Scholar, UpToDate,  Science  Direct,  and  Cochrane databases.  The keywords rheumatoid arthritis, physical activity, quality of life, pain, inflammation, fatigue, and cardiovascular diseases were the basis of the review. Studies published between 2004 and 2024 were included. 
Results: Most studies emphasized the positive effects of exercise, particularly aerobic and resistance training, on improving the clinical conditions and well-being of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, the papers with inconsistent results underscored the need to delve further into this topic.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a group of chronic conditions characterized by dysregulated immune responses and persistent inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and ulcerative colitis (UC) exemplify prominent IMIDs, each presenting unique challenges for their management, that impact patient's quality of life (QoL). Obesity, marked by persistent low‐grade inflammation, influences the progression, response to treatment, and clinical management of patients with RA, SpA, and UC. Besides, the emerging role of sarcopenic obesity, a special subtype of obesity with malnutrition, should be considered in the definition of the appropriated therapeutic interventions. Methods This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the interplay between obesity‐induced inflammation and IMIDs. Results Obesity contributes to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, influencing the inflammatory pathways common to IMIDs. White adipose tissue, acting as an endocrine organ, produces cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐6, fueling chronic inflammation. The dysregulation of adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, further complicates this interplay, impacting immune responses and metabolic processes. Conclusions Understanding the cross‐talk between inflammatory pathways in obesity and IMIDs can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. This includes lifestyle modifications aimed to regulate weight gain, paving the way for comprehensive strategies to manage IMIDs in the context of obesity.">

        <tr id="Objective Fatigue is important for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is poorly understood. We sought to study associations of fatigue with clinical features, disease activity, and synovial histology. Methods Patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR 1987 and/or 2010 RA criteria were recruited before elective total joint replacement. Demographics, RA characteristics, tender and swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C‐reactive protein, and patient‐reported fatigue, categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin stains of sectioned synovium were systematically scored by a pathologist. Relationships between fatigue and studied variables were evaluated with Kendall's tau. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was used to illustrate associations of exposures, outcome variables, mediators, and confounders. Multivariable ordered logistic regression was used to further study associations. Results Of 160 included patients, 85.6% were women, with a median age of 63.5 (55.25–71.40) and mean disease activity scores in 28 joints using ESR (DAS28‐ESR) of 3.91 (SD 1.3). There were no differences in comorbidities across fatigue categories. Fatigue correlated with DAS28‐ESR, synovial lining hyperplasia (SLH), anxiety, depression, and pain. In the DAG, DAS28‐ESR was associated with fatigue, full mediation by pain, partial mediation by depression and anxiety, and confounding by female sex. SLH was independently associated with fatigue but did not confound the relationship between DAS28‐ESR and fatigue. SLH was affected by synovial lymphocytic inflammation. In multivariable models, female sex, DAS28‐ESR, and SLH were all associated with higher fatigue. Conclusion Although fatigue is associated with DAS28‐ESR, it is also associated with SLH independently of disease activity.">

        <tr id="Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic
autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the
joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and functional
impairment. Traditional treatment options,
including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs), often come with limitations
related to efficacy, safety, and tolerability.
Igrutimod, a novel immunomodulatory agent, has
emerged as a potential therapeutic activity.
Methods:. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies
assessing Igrutimod's effects on disease activity,
adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes. The
primary outcome measure was the Disease Activity
Score (DAS28), which quantifies disease activity in
RA. Secondary outcomes included the assessment
of adverse events and improvements in quality of
life metrics.
Results:Results from multiple studies indicate that
Igrutimod significantly reduces DAS28 scores,
demonstrating a mean reduction of 2.5 to 3.1 points
over various study durations. The drug was welltolerated, with a reported adverse event rate
ranging from 8% to 12%, predominantly consisting
of mild to moderate side effects. Additionally,
improvements in quality of life were reported in
25% to 35% of patients, indicating a meaningful
impact on daily functioning and well-being.
Conclusion: Igrutimod represents a promising
advancement in Rheumatoid arthritis management,
with its ability to effectively decrease disease
activity and enhance quality of life">

RA, which is typically associated with the accumulation of hyperactive immune cells (HICs), particularly M1 proinflammatory macrophages, is accompanied by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased pH in the synovial membranes of the joints. In this work, a nano‐delivery system (MTX‐Mn3O4@PDA) is designed that can deliver photothermal materials, ROS scavengers, and synovial fibroblast inhibitors at the joint site for the treatment of RA. After injecting MTX‐Mn3O4@PDA into the inflamed site of RA, photothermal therapy is initiated by near‐infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, which resulted in the death of activated inflammatory cells at the lesion site. While polydopamine (PDA) slowly dissociates under stimulation by a low pH microenvironment. Subsequently, excess ROS interacts with the Mn3O4 nanozyme and the undissociated PDA nanozyme, promoting ROS clearance, while Methotrexate (MTX) inhibits the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts. Intra‐articular injection of MTX‐Mn3O4@PDA (7 mg kg−1) into collagen‐induced arthritis mice demonstrated efficacy in reducing toe swelling and significantly alleviating synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage degeneration. This nano‐delivery system has potential clinical applications for treating RA.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic systemic autoimmune disease that often results in irreversible joint erosion and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line drug against RA, but the significant side effects of long-term administration limit its use. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed for treating RA. Here, dual-targeting biomimetic carrier-free nanomaterials (BSA-MTX-CyI nanosystem, BMC) is developed for synergistic photo-chemotherapy of RA. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has high affinity with SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) in the RA joint microenvironment, is selected as the hydrophilic end and coupled with MTX and the phototherapeutic agent CyI to self-assemble into BMC. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that BMC accumulated significantly at the joint site in collagen antibody-induced arthritis mice and could be specifically recognized and taken up by folate receptors in proinflammatory M1 macrophages. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, CyI exerted photodynamic and photothermal effects, whereas MTX not only inhibited cell proliferation but also increased cell sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, enhancing the apoptotic effect induced by CyI and achieving synergistic photo-chemotherapy. Moreover, BMC could induce macrophages to reprogram into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This study provides innovative approaches for RA treatment via macrophage apoptosis and re-polarization.">

        <tr id=": Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease affecting the synovial joints, including the elbows, leading to significant joint damage and decreased quality of life. Objectives: This study evaluates the frequency of elbow joint involvement in RA patients by musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) and its impact on disease activity and quality of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 35 RA patients, and 35 healthy controls recruited from Benha University Hospitals. Patients were classified as having RA according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, ultrasound examination, and assessment of disease activity (DAS28) and quality of life (SF-36). Results: Right elbow involvement was observed in 63% of patients while 37% patients had a left one, with tenderness (97%) and flexion deformity (46%) being the most common clinical signs. Ultrasound revealed synovitis in 63%, effusion in 80%, and Doppler signal in 66% of patients. All SF-36 domain scores, including physical functioning (p < 0.001) and mental health (p < 0.001), were lower in RA patients with elbow affection. Conclusions: Ultrasound is a valuable tool for assessment of elbow involvement in RA. Elbow joints are frequently affected in RA patients with associated high disease activity and reduced quality of life.">

        <tr id="Prognostic factors in rheumatoid arthritis relate to several aspects, such as prediction of joint damage and loss of function or prediction of response to a particular therapy. Since many decades, it is well established that high disease activity, especially exemplified by swollen joint counts and acute phase reactants, is associated with progression of joint damage. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) positive patients, but not patients with anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) are particularly prone to high disease activity and joint destruction. Newer studied have looked at molecular markers, but they have either not shown better results than those seen with the long established ones or have not been sufficiently validated. Most recent insights suggest that high C-reactive protein levels may predict a particularly good response to IL-6 blockade, but not to other therapies, and that high RF-levels may be associated with better responses to Fc-free monoclonal antibodies than molecules containing an Fc-region. It is hoped, however, that with newer techniques and better insight into RA pathogenesis research may come up with even better molecular markers than currently available to predict responses to specific drugs in the not too distant future.">

We combined deep learning-based segmentation of knee joint structures with dimensionality reduction to create an embedded feature space of imaging biomarkers. Through cross-sectional cohort analysis and statistical modeling, we identified specific biomarkers, including variations in cartilage thickness and medial meniscus shape, that are significantly associated with OA incidence and KR outcomes. Integrating these findings into a comprehensive framework represents a considerable step toward personalized knee-joint digital twins, which could enhance therapeutic strategies and inform clinical decision-making in rheumatological care.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune illness, is characterized by synovitis, progressive joint damage, and bone erosion. Even though the potent drugs available contain biologics, several patients fail to react to them or cause hostile effects.


OBJECTIVES
Betanin (BTN), the betacyanin present in the red beetroot, has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and apoptotic properties. In this study, we assessed the anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effect of BTN on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The rats were arbitrarily separated into four sets: Normal, CIA, CIA+BTN (25 mg/kg bw), and CIA+BTN (50 mg/kg bw). The hematological, biochemical markers, cytokines, inflammatory enzymes, histopathology of the ankle joint, and protein expression of inflammatory and apoptotic proteins were studied.


RESULTS
Inflammatory enzymes, histopathological variations, cytokines generation, and joint inflammation were strongly alleviated, and apoptosis was augmented by BTN in a concentrationdependent manner. Bcl-2 and MAPK/NF-κB proteins were reduced, while the caspase-3, caspase- 9, and Bax were intensified. The anti-rheumatic action of BTN was correlated to the attenuation of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway, which suppresses cytokine production, inflammation, and reduced cartilage impairments.


CONCLUSION
These outcomes recommend that BTN can be employed as a strong healing alternative for RA management.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a life-long autoimmune disease caused by the confluence of genetic and environmental variables that lead to loss of self-tolerance and persistent joint inflammation. RA occurs at the highest incidence in individuals >65 years old, implicating the aging process in disease susceptibility. Transformative approaches in molecular immunology and in functional genomics have paved the way for pathway paradigms underlying the replacement of immune homeostasis with auto-destructive immunity in affected patients, including the process of immune aging. Patients with RA have a signature of premature immune aging, best understood for CD4+ T cells which function as pathogenic effectors in this HLA class II-associated disease. Premature immune aging is present in healthy HLA-DRB1*04+ individuals, placing accelerated immune aging prior to joint inflammation. Aging-related molecular abnormalities directly implicated in turning RA CD4+ T cells into pro-inflammatory effector cells are linked to malfunction of subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid droplets and the endoplasmic reticulum. Resulting changes in T cell behavior include cellular hypermobility; tissue invasiveness; unopposed mTORC activation; excessive release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF); lysosomal failure; clonal expansion and immunogenic cell death. Aged and metabolically reprogrammed T cells in RA patients are accompanied by age-associated B cells (ABC), which specialize in autoantibody production. Clonal hematopoiesis drives myeloid cell aging by producing aged monocytes and hypermetabolic macrophages (Mϕ) that sustain the process of inflammaging. Here, we synthesize insights into the relationship of RA risk and immune aging and discuss mechanisms through which immune aging can cause autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) is a distinct subtype of rheumatoid arthritis characterized by heightened treatment challenges due to immune aging and the complexity of comorbidities. This review systematically summarizes the definition, clinical features, epidemiological trends, therapeutic challenges, and the potential applications of biologic agents in EORA. It primarily focuses on the efficacy, safety, and individualized treatment strategies associated with various biologic agents. Studies indicate that biologics, such as TNF-α inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors, can significantly reduce inflammation and improve joint function in EORA patients. However, their long-term use is closely linked to increased risks of infections, thrombosis, and malignancies, underscoring the importance of personalized treatment approaches and dynamic monitoring. Moreover, the advent of novel biologic agents, including IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors, as well as second-generation JAK inhibitors, offers additional therapeutic options for refractory patients and demonstrates substantial potential in optimizing both efficacy and safety. With the rapid progress of precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, gene profiling, biomarker analysis, and AI-assisted decision-making are gradually steering EORA treatment towards more personalized and precise strategies. However, the high cost of treatment and the limited accessibility of these technologies remain significant barriers in clinical practice. Future research should focus on validating the long-term safety of novel therapies and refining individualized treatment strategies to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.">
